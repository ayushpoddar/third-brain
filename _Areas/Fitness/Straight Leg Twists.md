Once you reach level 3, you can move to [[Bent Leg Twists]]

## Ensuring good form
- Turn toward your bent leg. This will help you align the movement
- Feel one side of your body stretch as the other side contracts. Small adjustments can help you feel the movement a lot better over the time you practice
- Once you are in position, slightly look down as if you are trying to touch your chin to the shoulder.
	- This will help engage and stretch the muscles in the back of the neck
- Slow and steady

## Steps to perform
- Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you
- Place your right foot beside your left knee and cross it over so the foot is on the other side of the knee to your left.
- Turn towards your bent leg and place your left hand on your right side.. Place your right hand behind you
- Continue turning as hard as you safely can
- Breathe normally and hold for time
- Return to starting position and do the exact same on the other side
- Rest 30 seconds before repeating again
