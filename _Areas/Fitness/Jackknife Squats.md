## Progression standards
- **LEVEL 1**: 2 Sets of 15
- **LEVEL 2**: 2 Sets of 25
- **LEVEL 3**: 3 Sets of 35

After reading level 3, you can move to [[Assisted Squats]]

## Ensuring good form
- Legs should be approximately shoulder width apart
- Feet should point forward or slightly out. Don’t point them excessively out
- Slow and steady - *2 Seconds Down, 1 Second Pause, 2 Seconds Up. Repeat*
- Try to keep your back neutral.
	- The lower back may round at the very bottom of the movement, which is usually fine
- Tighten your core and abs. You should feel your body "hinge" at the hips

## Steps to perform
- Stand in front of a stable platform around knee height
- Maintaining straight legs, bend at the hips until your palms are on the platform. Your arms should be relatively straight, as should your waist
- Squat down slowly, with a slightly forward lean so you may assist with your arms, until your hamstrings are pressed against your calves
- Pause for 1 second
- Slowly come back up
- Pause for 1 second
- Repeat

## How to make it easier
- This exercise is easier if you do not squat down as deeply, or if increase assistance from your arms in this range.
	- Over time, increase squat depth and reduce arm assistance.
- Alternatively, you can squat into a very low chair or stool.
	- This “resting spot” will make the bottom portion easier and track your progress

## How to make it harder
- Doing this with a slightly higher platform may make assistance more difficult
