- First exercise in the [[Bridges|bridges progression]]
- Back muscles are mostly working isometrically, so this gives most of the movement work to our glutes
	- Our back still gets a good workout

## Progression levels
- **LEVEL 1**: 2 Sets of 15
- **LEVEL 2**: 2 Sets of 30
- **LEVEL 3**: 3 Sets of 50

After reaching level 3, progress to [[Straight Bridges]]

## Ensuring good form
- Your foot placement affects difficulty
	- Keep your shins perpendicular to the ground
	- Have your heels a few inches from your butt
- Try to avoid sagging at the hips.
	- If this is difficult, move your feet closer or press more with your arms
- Have your legs around shoulder width apart
- Your feet should point forward or slightly out
- Slow and steady
- Keep the back neutral
- Tighten your core and abs during the movement.
	- You want to feel your body “hinge” at the hips

## Steps to perform this exercise
- Lie on your back with your knees bent. Your legs should be shoulder width apart
- Contract your glutes while maintaining a neutral back. This should thrust your hips upward
- Continue this movement until your thighs, trunk, and torso are in a straight line
- Pause for 1 second
- Slowly come down
- Pause for 1 second
- Repeat
