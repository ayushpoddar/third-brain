## How to "stay" wealthy?
- Combination of frugality and paranoia
- Realise that some of the wealth accumulated can be attributed to success. So there is no repeatable formula for success
- The key word is **survival**, not *growth* or *brains* or *insight*
	- The ability to stick around for a long time, without getting wiped out
	- Stick around all the unpredictable ups and downs of life
	- Sticking around will allow compounding to take effect to show its power

## What Warren Buffet didn't do?
- He didn't get carried away with debt
- He didn't panic and sell during the 14-year recession he's lived through
- He didn't sully his reputation
- He didn't attach himself to one worldview, one strategy, etc
- He didn't rely on others' money much
- He didn't burn himself out and quit or retire
- **HE SURVIVED!**

## Difference between getting wealthy and staying wealthy
| **Getting wealth** | **Staying wealthy** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Requires taking risks | Requires humility
| Being optimistic | Fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast
| Putting yourself out there | Requires frugality and acceptance that some of what you've made can be attributed to luck.
| ---- | Past success cannot be relied upon to be repeatable

## Lessons to keep in mind

- [[Be optimistic about the future; but paranoid about the short term]]

## Words of Michael Moritz, billionaire head of Sequoia

> [!quote]- We assume that tomorrow won’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good fortune.
