- There is evidence to suggest that there have been five distinct ice ages
- This cycle, expectedly, requires enormous energy

## Study by Milutin Milanković
- Serbian scientist
- Study done in early 1900s
- Studied the earth's position relative to other planets and came up with the theory of ice ages

### Theory of ice ages
- Gravitational pull of the sun and moon gently affect Earth's motion and tilt toward the sun
- During parts of this cycle, which can last tens of thousands of years, each of the Earth's hemispheres gets a little more or a little less solar radiation than they're used to
- Milutin Milanković's theory initially assumed that "the tilt" caused the ravenous winters

### Addendum by Wladimir Köppen
- Russian meteorologist
- He dug deeper into Milutin's work

#### What he found?
- Moderately cool summers, not cold winters were the culprit
- Begins when the summer never gets warm enough to melt previous winter's snow
- The leftover ice makes it easier for snow to accumulate the following winter
- This increases the odds of snow sticking around in the following summer
- Perpetual snow reflects more sunlight which makes things even cooler
- A few hundred years -> a seasonal icepack grows into a continental ice sheet

- The same thing happens in reverse; when orbital tilt lets in more sunlight
- Slowly, temperatures increase
