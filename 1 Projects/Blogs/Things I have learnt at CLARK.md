As my time at CLARK comes to an end, I see this as the right opportunity to look back and reflect on all the things I have learnt and how I have grown over the last year and 8 months.
I have found some wonderful mentors who have helped me by providing me with critical feedback when required, while also encouraging me in the things I have doing right.
Of course, there are many things which could have been improved. Many things that I could have been different. But, life doesn't have a reset button and there's always something we could have done better or different.
