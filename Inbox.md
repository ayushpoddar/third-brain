- Origin of open source software movement
	- Grew out of the related, but separate, "free software" movement
	- In 1983, Richard Stallman - a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory - said he would create a free alternative to the Unix operating system (then owned by AT&T).
		- He called his alternative - GNU (GNU's Not Unix)
	- For him, the idea of "free software" was about ensuring that users were free to use software as they saw fit, free to study its source code, free to modify it for their own purposes, and free to share it with others.
	- He released his code under a license known as the GNU Public License, or GPL which guarantees users those four software freedoms.
		- The GPL is a viral license, meaning that anyone who creates software based on code licensed under the GPL must also release that derivative code under a GPL license.
		- The license also doesn't forbid companies from selling copies of GNU software, as long as they allow their customers to share their code.
	- Soon, Linus Torvalds - a Finnish programmer - created the Linux operating system in 1991.
		- Linux is a kernel - the core of an operating system that talks to the hardware and translates inputs such as mouse, keyboard, etc into something that the software can understand
	- GNU lacked a finished kernel at the time. So, many GNU users combined GNU and Linux into a functional operating system. These bundles became known as GNU/Linux distributions.
	- Companies like Red Hat were making money selling support for open source technologies like Linux.
	- Tensions grew between people like Stallman, who believed that all software should be free on ethical grounds, and more business-oriented developers who thought that freely sharing code was a better way to build software but not an ethical imperative.
	- In 1998, a group met to discuss how to promote the idea of shared code and open collaboration. The group settled on the label "open source" - coined by Christine Peterson - to distinguish its aims
- Problems in open source
	- In 2014, security researchers revealed serious vulnerabilities in two crucial open source projects: OpenSSL and Bash.
		- Many crucial open source projects rely on lesser-known open source components that are run by volunteers who have little time to fix problems, and no money to hire security auditors.
	- Some companies that have businesses built around open source products are adopting controversial licensing schemes.
		- For example, MongoDB created a new license in 2018 that restricts how other companies can use its MongoDB Community Server.
	- Funding problems
	- Open Source workforce is even less diverse than the tech industry as a whole - according to a survey conducted in 2017 by Github.
		- Many of the respondents had also witnessed bad behavior - such as rudeness, name calling, etc.
		- This can be a problem since open source contributions play a major role in tech industry hiring. If women and minorities are harassed in the world of open source, then the tech industry becomes even less diverse
- Innovative licenses in the world of Open Source
	- Fair Source: Requires companies with more than 15 employees to pay a fee to use the software
	- Commons Clause: You can view the source code, but you cannot do whatever you want with the code.
- Innovative business models
	- Red Hat makes money by selling support for its open source projects.
		- But, this model is not feasible for every open source project.
	- Company called Tidelift aims to sell support through a single subscription fee for a package of open source projects.
