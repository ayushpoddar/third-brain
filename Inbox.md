- In India, mutual fund industry has a three-part structure
	- Someone who has the interest to set up a mutual fund, called **sponsor**
	- Sponsor sets up a trust and an asset management company (AMC)
	- Money collected from the investors belong to a trust.
	- Sponsor appoints the trustees who are the custodians of the investors' money

	- Gold - Buy gold

- Average maturity: Average holding period of all the bonds/stocks in a fund

- Gold ETF: One unit of ETF is equal to 1 gram of gold.
