- Returns should always be evaluated taking into account the costs, inflation and taxes
- Section 80C
	- Tax break of up to Rs 1.5 lakhs if you invest in the eligible products.
	- Eligible products:
		- Provident fund
		- Public provident fund (PPF)
		- Life insurance premiums
		- ELSS mutual funds
		- NPS
		- Special five-year fixed deposits
- Capital gains
	- Short-term capital gains
		- For example, in a debt fund if you sell before 3 years of holding the fund, you have to pay a short-term capital gain tax on the profit
			- The profit gets added to your income and you pay tax as per the slab rate
		- If you hold the debt fund for more than 3 years, your profit becomes long-term and you pay tax that is usually lower than the highest tax rate
- Each of your goals need their own allocation between debt and equity
- Closer you are to the goal, lesser should be the equity part of the portfolio
- Emergency fund options
	- Fixed deposits
		- Pick the FD that gives the highest interest from a large scheduled commercial bank
		- You can use a flexi account that some banks offer to have the facility to sweep out the money you need from the FD into the savings deposit instantly
	- Debt mutual fund
		- Choose a conservative fund, not aggressive
		- Don't buy a product based on just high returns
		- Ensure that the top holding of the debt fund is in AAA-rated bonds
- Short-term goals
	- Recommended products are similar to that for emergency fund
	- You could also use ultra-short-term debt fund or conservative hybrid mutual funds
	- Keep maximum equity exposure to 25% and keep the rest in bonds
	- Why don't we need a pure equity fund for this?
		- Because equity is volatile and we want certainty about the availability of the money

- Retirement fund
	- Core is your PF and PPF
	- Rest in equity funds
		- Further away from retirement you are, the more risk you can take
			- People in 30s can choose a larger allocation to mid-cap, small-cap and sector funds
			- People in 40s should choose conservative funds with large-cap, diversified equity and multi-cap funds
- Stockbrokers encourage people to trade on the stock market, rather than invest because they make money each time you buy and sell
- In case of death:
	- If you die without a will, you house, gold, car, mutual funds, jewellery will go your legal heirs.
	- Who the legal heirs are will depend on your religion in India and which personal law applies to you
- Creating a will
	- Nominee will be the caretaker of the asset, somebody to whom the money flows to for safekeeping till the legal heirs can stake a claim
	- Legal heir and nominee are not the same person in the eyes of the law
	- You need to appoint an executor of the will
		- Ideally the beneficiary of the will is not the executor
		- Examples: Family friend, lawyer, financial planner, etc
	- You can write the will in a piece of paper, sign it with a date and place, and get two witnesses to sign as well
	- The witness and the beneficiary should be two different people, and the witness and the executor should be younger than you
	- Ensure that each page of the will is numbered, signed and mentions the date of the will
- Don't invest in things you don't understand
