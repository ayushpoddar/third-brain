- Two entities in the market
	- Distributors
		- Supposed to just vend the product, like a chemist vends medicines but not prescribe them
	- Advisers
		- Equivalent to a doctor - supposed to advise you for a fee
- Direct and Regular plans
	- Direct
		- Removes the sales commission embedded in the expense ratio to make the product cheaper to buy
	- Regular
		- Includes the sales commission
- Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
	- Recurring deposit allowing you to make periodic investments into a mutual fund
	- Benefit:
		- Since the market is unpredictable, making one lump-sum investment leaves us open to the risk of a sudden market crash
		- SIPs allows you to buy more when the markets are down and less when the markets are hot
- Recommendation: You can put your money in a liquid fund and set up a monthly (or weekly or fortnightly) transfer into an equity scheme.
	- You have to choose a liquid fund of the same fund house whose equity fund you want to buy through an STP (Systematic Transfer Plan)
- Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)
	- Facility to periodically redeem your units to generate an income
	- Similar to a dividend plan, but in this case you can control the amount of money you want to withdraw
- Expense ratio
	- Usually a percentage of the money in the investment
	- Low for debt-oriented products and high for equity-oriented products
- When buying a product
	- Ask for average annual return of the product for the last 3, 5 and 10 years
	- Ask to see benchmark returns
	- Ask to see category returns
		- Average return of the category of the product
- Lock in period:
	- Period of time for which you cannot withdraw your money
- Premium paying term may be different than the policy tenure
- Recommendation:
