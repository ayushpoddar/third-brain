- ELSS:
	- Equity fund with tax benefit
	- Has 3-year lock in period
	- Growth option is recommended
- Three kinds of balanced funds:
	- Conservative
		- Between 10 and 25% equity
	- Balanced
		- Between 40 and 60% equity
	- Aggressive
		- Between 65 and 80% equity
- NAV
	- Price of a unit of a scheme
	- Net asset value
	- Not 'gross', because the costs have been removed from the price. You get the net value in hand
	- Example:
		- 100 investors.
		- Each has invested Rs 1000 in the fund
		- Each bought a unit for the price of Rs 10 - each investor holds 100 units
		- Total invested value of the fund: Rs 1 lakh
		- A year later, the mutual fund becomes worth Rs 1.5 lakh giving a profit of Rs 50,000
		- Assume that the fund costs are Rs 10,000, then the net profit is Rs 40,000
		- Thus, the NAV becomes Rs 14 from Rs 10.
		- Multiplying the NAV with the number of units in the fund gives your fund return. In this case, each investor's invested value increases from Rs 1000 to Rs 1400.
- Market linked products (like stocks, real estate, gold, etc.) have three kinds of costs:
	- Front load: Cost to enter the product
		- It is part of the price of the product (embedded in the price of the product)
		- Mutual funds have zero front loads generally
	- Expense ratio: 
		- Fees to take care of the running costs of investments managers each year
		- Includes the sales commission paid to sellers to mutual funds
	- Exit cost:
		- Cost of selling the product
		- Usually falls off to zero if you hold the product for one or two years and more
