- Questions to ask when buying a mutual fund:
	- Does the 'average maturity' of the fund match my holding period
	- What is the quality of the portfolio of the scheme?
		- Higher the quality - lower the potential return
		- If you don't want risk in your debt fund, choose high quality paper debt funds
- Liquid funds: Short maturity (maturity of 3 months) are bought
- Check for credit quality of your liquid fund - must be high to ensure that money is safe.
- Conservative balanced fund: Debt funds with a small flavour of equity. Cushions against volatility of equity, but adds to the overall returns
- Gold ETF: One unit of ETF is equal to 1 gram of gold.
- Diversification reduces the negative impact of an imploding stock. Conversely, it also reduces the positive impact of an exploding impact.
- Active fund: A mutual fund where the fund manager manages the money by trading every day. They choose the stocks to fit the investment mandate by regularly analysing the market.
- Passive fund: Buys the index and stays with it. Cost less than active funds since they don't invest in large research desks, or brokers and dealers.
- Two kinds of passive funds:
	- Index fund
		- Tracks the index and invests as a mutual fund
		- No demat account needed
		- Buys at the price at the end of the day
		- Costs between ten basis points to 1% (ten paise to Rs 10 on every Rs 1000 invested)
	- Exchange traded fund (ETF)
		- Tracks an index like the Sensex but lists its units on a stock exchange unlike a mutual fund.
		- Need a demat account
		- Can buy at any point in the day (The difference in the price of the index between a given point in the day and the price at the end of day is not relevant to retail investors like us)
		- Extremely cheap. Price can be as low as one basis point (one paise for every Rs 1000 invested)
		- Liquidity may not be good. When you want to sell a large quantity, you may not get the current market price
