- In case of death:
- Creating a will
	- Legal heir and nominee are not the same person in the eyes of the law
	- You need to appoint an executor of the will
		- Ideally the beneficiary of the will is not the executor
		- Examples: Family friend, lawyer, financial planner, etc
	- You can write the will in a piece of paper, sign it with a date and place, and get two witnesses to sign as well
	- The witness and the beneficiary should be two different people, and the witness and the executor should be younger than you
	- Ensure that each page of the will is numbered, signed and mentions the date of the will
- Don't invest in things you don't understand
