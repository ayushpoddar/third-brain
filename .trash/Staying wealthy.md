## Difference between getting wealthy and staying wealthy
| **Getting wealth** | **Staying wealthy** |
|----------------|-----------------|

| Putting yourself out there | Requires frugality and acceptance that some of what you've made can be attributed to luck.

- [[Be optimistic about the future; but paranoid about the short term]]

## Words of Michael Moritz, billionaire head of Sequoia

> [!quote]- We assume that tomorrow won’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good fortune.
