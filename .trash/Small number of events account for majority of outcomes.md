- As an investor, 99% of the investments in your portfolio may turn out to be duds. But, the 1% may be stupendously right and can make you a fortune
- An investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. **It is normal for a lot of things to fail.**
	- So, we must avoid overreacting when things fail
- Being right or wrong isn't that important. The important thing is how much you make when you are right, and how much you lose when wrong.
> Grow your profits when right, cut your losses when wrong



## Example 
- At the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2013, Warren Buffet said that most of his wealth came from around 10 of his 300 to 400 stocks
