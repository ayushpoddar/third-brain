## ENIAC
- Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC). [Source](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/six-female-programmers-behind-eniac/)
- pre-transistor processing system recognized as the first equivalent to what we now consider a “computer”—i.e., a digital and primarily electrical device that can manipulate data, perform mathematical operations, and follow a sequence of customized instructions created by a human being. [Source](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/six-female-programmers-behind-eniac/)
- first programmable, electronic, general purpose digital computer. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC)
- Completed in 1945
- designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for United States Army's ballistic research laboratory

## This excerpt from wikipedia
[Kay McNulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli "Kathleen Antonelli"), [Betty Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik "Jean Bartik"), [Betty Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton "Betty Holberton"), [Marlyn Meltzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlyn_Wescoff "Marlyn Wescoff"), [Fran Bilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Spence "Frances Spence"), and [Ruth Lichterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Teitelbaum "Ruth Teitelbaum") were the first programmers of the ENIAC. They were not, as computer scientist and historian Kathryn Kleiman was once told, "refrigerator ladies", i.e., models posing in front of the machine for press photography.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-refrigerator-41) Nevertheless, some of the women did not receive recognition for their work on the ENIAC in their lifetimes.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18) After the war ended, the women continued to work on the ENIAC. Their expertise made their positions difficult to replace with returning soldiers.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-42)

These early programmers were drawn from a group of about two hundred women employed as [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation) "Computer (occupation)") at the [Moore School of Electrical Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_School_of_Electrical_Engineering "Moore School of Electrical Engineering") at the University of Pennsylvania. The job of computers was to produce the numeric result of mathematical formulas needed for a scientific study, or an engineering project. They usually did so with a mechanical calculator. The women studied the machine's logic, physical structure, operation, and circuitry in order to not only understand the mathematics of computing, but also the machine itself.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18) This was one of the few technical job categories available to women at that time.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-43) [Betty Holberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton "Betty Holberton") (née Snyder) continued on to help write the first generative programming system ([SORT/MERGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_sort_merge "Mainframe sort merge")) and help design the first commercial electronic computers, the [UNIVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC "UNIVAC") and the [BINAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BINAC "BINAC"), alongside Jean Jennings.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-beyer-44) McNulty developed the use of [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine "Subroutine") in order to help increase ENIAC's computational capability.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-:4-45)

[Herman Goldstine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Goldstine "Herman Goldstine") selected the programmers, whom he called operators, from the computers who had been calculating ballistics tables with mechanical desk calculators, and a differential analyzer prior to and during the development of ENIAC.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18) Under Herman and [Adele Goldstine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Goldstine "Adele Goldstine")'s direction, the computers studied ENIAC's blueprints and physical structure to determine how to manipulate its switches and cables, as [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") did not yet exist. Though contemporaries considered programming a clerical task and did not publicly recognize the programmers' effect on the successful operation and announcement of ENIAC,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18) McNulty, Jennings, Snyder, Wescoff, Bilas, and Lichterman have since been recognized for their contributions to computing.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-invisible-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-secret-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-siff-48) Three of the current (2020) Army supercomputers _Jean_, _Kay_, and _Betty_ are named for [Jean Bartik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik "Jean Bartik") (Betty Jennings), [Kay McNulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli "Kathleen Antonelli"), and [Betty Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton "Betty Holberton") respectively.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-49)

The "programmer" and "operator" job titles were not originally considered professions suitable for women. The labor shortage created by World War II helped enable the entry of women into the field.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18) However, the field was not viewed as prestigious, and bringing in women was viewed as a way to free men up for more skilled labor. Essentially, women were seen as meeting a need in a temporary crisis.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18) For example, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics said in 1942, "It is felt that enough greater return is obtained by freeing the engineers from calculating detail to overcome any increased expenses in the computers' salaries. The engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they would. This is due in large measure to the feeling among the engineers that their college and industrial experience is being wasted and thwarted by mere repetitive calculation".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight1999-18)

Following the initial six programmers, an expanded team of a hundred scientists was recruited to continue work on the ENIAC. Among these were several women, including [Gloria Ruth Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Gordon_Bolotsky "Gloria Gordon Bolotsky").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-wapobit-50) Adele Goldstine wrote the original technical description of the ENIAC.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#cite_note-51)
