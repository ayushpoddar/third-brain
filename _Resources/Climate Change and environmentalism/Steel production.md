## How is steel produced?
- Mix carbon and iron at very high temperatures
- Process is energy-intensive

## Emissions related to steel production
- Approximately, 1.85 tonnes of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere for every tonne of steel produced

> [!warning] The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) warned in 2020:
> It said that the carbon dioxide emissions from steel production were likely to soar 3.5 times in the next 30 years

## Role of India
As noted [[Steel production in India|here]], India is a major culprit in emissions due to steel production.

### Reason behind such unusually high emissions
- 45% of all steel in India is produced using Blast Furnace-Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF), which combines carbon in coking coal with oxygen to form Carbon Dioxide

### Solution to the high emissions
- Electric arc furnace or induction furnace
	- [[How electric arc furnace reduces emissions during steel production]]

### What is stopping India from reducing the emissions
- As noted [[How electric arc furnace reduces emissions during steel production|here]], electric arc furnace needs scrap steel to reduce significant emissions. 
	- India has a shortage of scrap steel

> [!fact] In 2017, India had a shortage of 7 million tonnes of scrap steel

- India has $184 billion worth of BOF plants under development and each of such furnace lasts for 20-40 years. Due to investment in place, it is unlikely that companies will be willing to forego their investment.
