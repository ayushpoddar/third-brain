	- Ability to do what you want
	- When you want to do it
	- With whom you want to do it
	- And for as long as you want to
- Money can give you control over your time
	- Doing something on a schedule you can't control in order to earn more money is just <u>not worth it</u>

## Jonah Berger on feeling in control
- She is a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania

>People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.
