- First exercise in the [[Pushups|pushup progression]]

## Making progress
- **Level 1**: 2 sets of 30
- **Level 2**: 2 sets of 50
- **Level 3**: 3 sets of 50
Once you achieve level 3, move on to [[Incline pushups]]

## Ensuring proper form
- Keep it slow and steady - 2 seconds up, 1 second pause, 2 seconds down, 1 second pause
- Hands around chest height
	- **Rule of thumb**: If you can maintain flat palms and feel a slight stretch in your wrist while your arms are straight, then your form is OK
- Keep body firm. Don't arch your body at the bottom

## Steps to do
- Stand at arm's length facing a wall
- Place your flat palms on the wall. Your arms should be straight
- Descend slowly until your head almost touches the wall
- Come back up
- Repeat
