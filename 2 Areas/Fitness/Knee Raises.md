## Making progress
- **Level 1**: 2 sets of 10
- **Level 2**: 2 sets of 20
- **Level 3**: 2 sets of 30
After hitting Level 3, you can progress to [[Advanced knee raises]]

## Ensuring good form
- Keep your heels off the ground throughout the exercise. Touching the ground at the bottom of this movement makes this exercise easier
- The more you extend the knees, the harder this exercise. Try to maintain a 90 degree bend at the knees
- Try to keep your lower back on the ground throughout the exercise. Even if it is impossible for you to do so, maintain the intent to do so
- Record a video to get feedback
- If your lower back hurts, place a small pillow or a small rolled up towel under the lower back
- Keep your thighs pressed together. This will help focus on the movement

## Steps to do
- Lie flat on the floor with your arms by your side
- Bend the knees to approximately 90 degree
- Bring your legs up until your knees are over your waist
- Pause
- Slowly descend while straightening the legs. Keep your heels about 1 inch off the ground
- Pause
- Repeat

## Making it easier
- Bending knees more will make the exercise easier
- Raising and descending one leg at a time (like riding a bicycle) is an easier variation

## Making it harder
- Straightening your knees a bit will make the exercise harder
