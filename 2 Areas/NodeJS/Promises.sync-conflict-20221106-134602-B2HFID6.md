Promises are objects that basically execute the code inside them asynchronously, and make the return value of the "inside-code" available for all to use.

## States of promises
- Pending promise: The code inside the promise has not been executed yet.
- Resolved promise
	- Fulfilled promise
	- Rejected promise
