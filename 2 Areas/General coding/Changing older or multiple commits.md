*In the above image, the green commits are formed after a rebase*

- Rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit

> [!NOTE] Rebase the current branch on master
> `git rebase master`
> This will change the commits in such a way that it would appear that your current branch was created off the latest `master` commit

## Two modes of `git rebase`
### Manual / Standard
```git
git rebase <baseBranch>
