## Steps to solve a problem
- Understand the problem
	- What are the unknowns, knowns?
	- Is the problem solvable?
	- What are the stakeholder requirements
	- What are expected output and inputs
	- What are the intended side effects
- Devise a plan
- Implement the plan
	- Write the code
- Reflect/Revise
	- Refactor
	- Think about the decisions made

## Devising a plan
- Draw a figure
- Be systematic
- Consider if the problem is similar to another problem previously solved
	- The problem may be an extension of an existing solved problem
	- Or the problem may be reformulated into a known form with a little bit of work
- Induction - Generalize the problem from specific cases
- Decomposing/Recomposing
	- Break down the problem into parts (the parts may or may not look similar)
	- Solve those part problems
	- Join back them together
- Solve the easier version of the problem (auxiliary problem)
	- If the original problem is too hard, then solving its easier version is a good idea
	- By solving the easier problem, you learn a few things which may be able to help you solve the original (hard) problem
- Define things
	- Like function names, variables, etc
	- By naming various parts of the problem, our brain can assume that the part has been solved even though the implementation of that particular part (function) remains
- Walking backwards
	- Assume that you have solved 99% of the problem, then what would be required to go from 99% to 100%
	- Once this is done, we can try to figure out the step required from 98% to 99%
