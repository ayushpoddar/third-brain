- Buys the index and stays with it.
- Cost less than [[Active mutual funds|active funds]] since they don't invest in large research desks, or brokers and dealers.

## Super returns of an passive fund
- With index fund, you also get the benefits of the dividends declared and the bonus shares issued as you hold the index.
- Adding this all up, over time it gives you super returns

## Safest way to get average market returns
- If you don't want the risk of having a managed fund, and are frozen between *direct stocks* and market-linked products such as *unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs)*, *mutual funds*:
	- Choose an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or an index fund linked to a broad market index or a mid-cap index.

### Benefits of a passive fund
- An average equity [[Active mutual funds|active fund]] costs 2% of the returns every year.
- The cheapest ETF only costs 0.03%.
- Over a long period of time (~20 years), the difference in cost will be significant if your managed fund does not beat the index significantly.
