- Everyone (including investors) has different goals and time horizons
- Prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the priorities for both of them are different.
- Nobody can tell you what to do with your money unless they know your goals, your priorities, your emotional endurance, etc.

> [!NOTE] It is hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than we do, because an anchor of psychology is not realizing that rational people can see the world through a different lens than your own

## Explaining with an example
- If an asset is consistently moving up for a period of time *(has momentum)*, its not crazy for a short term trader to assume it will keep moving up.
	- They don't need it to be moving up indefinitely, just for the short time that they will be invested *(typically a day to few weeks)*
	- Even if an asset is over-valued, that is not a concern for a short-term trader since they just need it to move up slightly.
	- However, a long-term investor would find it ridiculous to invest in such an asset
