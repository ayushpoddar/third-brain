- Everyone (including investors) has different goals and time horizons
- Prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the priorities for both of them are different.
- Nobody can tell you what to do with your money unless they know your goals, your priorities, your emotional endurance, etc.

> [!NOTE] It is hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than we do, because an anchor of psychology is not realizing that rational people can see the world through a different lens than your own
