It is stored as a sequence of bits, organised in 8-bit chunks (bytes). Generally, it will be done in something similar to this:

## More
- All information in a system (disk files, memory, etc.) is stored as a bunch of bits.
	- The only thing that distinguishes them is the context in which we view them.
	- The same bunch of bits can mean an integer, a floating point, a machine instruction, etc. depending on the context in which we read them.
