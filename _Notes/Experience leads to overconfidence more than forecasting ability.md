- Experiencing specific events does not necessarily qualify you to know what will happen next
- The most important events in historical data are the big outliers - [[Small number of events account for majority of outcomes - Tail events|tail events]]
	- Examples include: The Great Depression, World War 2, Dot-com bubble, 9/11, etc.
	- These outliers play an enormous role because they influence many unrelated events
 - Among the 15 billion people born in the 19th and 20th centuries, these six people probably had a major influence in shaping the world as we see it today:
	 - Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Thomas Edison, Bill Gates, Martin Luther King, etc
- Further you go back in time, the more likely you are that you are examining a world that no longer applies to today.
	- Since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because its more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.

## These tail events are a surprise
- Each such outlier events is once-in-a-millenium kind of an event.
- They surprise us. We can **never be prepared enough for them**
