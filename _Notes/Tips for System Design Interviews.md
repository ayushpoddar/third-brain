## General tips
### Don't jump into solution mode
- After getting the question in the interview, don't jump into the final design
	- This approach is likely to lead you to design the wrong system

### Ask questions
- One of the most important skills as an engineer is to ask the right questions, make the proper assumptions, and gather all the information needed to build a system. So, **ask questions!!**

#### Example questions
- What specific features are we going to build?
- How many users does the product have?
- How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?
- What is the companyâ€™s technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?

## Tips for back of the envelop estimations
- Back of the envelop estimations are all about the process. Solving the problem is more important than obtaining results
- Precision is not expected. Approximate calculations instead of wasting time in performing exact calculations
- Write down your assumptions, in order to reference later.
- Label your units.
