As noted [[India is the second largest producer of steel|here]], India is a major culprit in emissions due to steel production.

### Reason behind such unusually high emissions
- 45% of all steel in India is produced using Blast Furnace-Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF), which combines carbon in coking coal with oxygen to form Carbon Dioxide

### Solution to the high emissions
- Electric arc furnace or induction furnace
	- [[How electric arc furnace reduces emissions during steel production]]

### What is stopping India from reducing the emissions
- As noted [[How electric arc furnace reduces emissions during steel production|here]], electric arc furnace needs scrap steel to reduce significant emissions. 
	- India has a shortage of scrap steel

> [!fact] In 2017, India had a shortage of 7 million tonnes of scrap steel

- India has $184 billion worth of BOF plants under development and each of such furnace lasts for 20-40 years. Due to investment in place, it is unlikely that companies will be willing to forego their investment.
