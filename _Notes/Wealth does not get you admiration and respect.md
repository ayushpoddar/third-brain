- We believe that having expensive stuff will bring us **respect and admiration**
	- It almost never does, especially from the people you want these from

## Example to prove the point
When we see someone driving a nice expensive car, we rarely think that the "**guy driving the car is cool**"

Instead, we think that **"if I had that car people would think I'm cool"**
