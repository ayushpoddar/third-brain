- Most open source projects have trouble raising enough funds to ensure that the maintainers can live off the project.
- Some companies that have businesses built around open source products are adopting controversial licensing schemes - in order to raise funds
	- For example, MongoDB created a new license in 2018 that restricts how other companies can use its MongoDB Community Server.

## Attempts at solving this problem
- Some companies have also come up with innovative open source software licenses - [[Fair Source License]], [[Commons Clause License]], etc.
- There have been innovative business models adopted by some companies.
	- For example: Red Hat makes money by selling support for its open source projects.
		- But, this model is not feasible for every open source project.
	- A company called *Tidelift* aims to sell support through a single subscription fee for a package of open source projects.
