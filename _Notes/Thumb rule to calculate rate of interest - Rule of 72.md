- If your money doubles in $x$ years, then the approximate rate of interest can be calculated using:
$$
\text{Rate of interest}\simeq \dfrac{72}{x}
$$

## Example
- If your principal amount of Rs 1 lakh doubles to Rs 2 lakh in 15 years, then the approximate rate of interest $\simeq 72/15 = 4.8\%$.
- The exact rate of interest is $4.73\%$ which is quite close
