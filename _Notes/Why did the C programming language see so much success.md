- C was developed from the beginning as the the system programming language for Unix.
- Most of the Unix kernel and all of its supporting libraries and tools, were written in C.
- With the popularity of Unix in universities in the late 1970s and early 1980s, many people were exposed to it and they liked it.
- Unix was almost written in C, it could be easily ported to new machines. This created an even wider audience for both C and Unix.
- C is a small, simple language. Since the design was controlled by a single person, the result was a clean and consistent design with little baggage.
