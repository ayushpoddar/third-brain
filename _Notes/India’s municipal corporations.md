> [!fact] Municipal corporations were given more authority due to a constitution amendment in 1992
> - Led to formal recognition of these local bodies in the governance hierarchy
> - More decentralization

- There are 18 functions that are handed over to municipal corporations, such as urban planning, roads, water supply, etc.
- By law, municipal corporations are required to maintain a balanced or surplus budget

## Revenue generation
- They can generate revenue through taxes, fees, fines and charges
- In most cases, they can’t tax people directly
- The state and centre government handles taxation and transfers some of the proceeds to municipal corporations

> [!fact] 40% of municipal revenue comes from central and state governments

### How does the state decide on the tax amount to be given to the municipal corporations
- The state governments have to set up a State Finance Commission(SFC) every 5 years
	- State Finance Commission is incharge of determining the allocation of funds to municipal corporations

## How is the state government failing municipal corporations?
- In many states, SFCs have not been set up in time.

> [!example] As of 2022, Rajasthan has set up 6 SFCs, Gujarat has set up 3 SFCs in the same time
- SFCs take 32 months (~3 years) on average to submit a report. Then there is a delay of 16 months. 
	- Then state governments take 11 months on average to table their reports in the state assembly

## With hardly any revenue, how do municipal corporations do any work

> [!example] The municipal corporation of Bengaluru (BBMP) handed over 11 of its properties to banks in 2011 in a bid to raise funds - including the famous K R market and the Public Utility Building.
> In 2013, it used the Town Hall building as collateral for funds too
