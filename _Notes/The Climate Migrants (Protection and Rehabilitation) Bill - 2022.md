- Proposed by [[Pradyut Bordoloi]]
- Meant to *establish an appropriate policy framework for the protection and rehabilitation of internally displaced climate migrants and for all matters connected therewith and incidental thereto*

## What does Pradyut Bordoloi say to validate the bill
- The [[The riverine islands in Assam|riverine islands of Assam]] are disappearing rapidly
- Deforestation in the upper reaches of Brahmaputra and climatic shifts are the main reasons
- India, Philippines, Bangladesh, China top the list of the countries that face maximum displacement due to climate change-induced natural disasters
- Under present international laws, such migrants have very few legal options available since it is hard to pin down climactic reasons as the primary cause of migration.
- As per **1951 Refugee convention**, legal protection is afforded only to those fleeing their home "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion."

### Looking at the displacements using numbers
- According to an **Action Aid report**, he says, 14 million people have already been displaced in India due to climate change. “Another ~50 million will be compelled to migrate by 2050 due to climate-related events, such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. And these numbers are based on projections that are very conservative.”
