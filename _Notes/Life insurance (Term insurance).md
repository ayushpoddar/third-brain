> [!success] The real value of your life insurance is the amount that the beneficiary gets if you die

## How does it look like in its purest form?
- It is called a **term plan**
- It should pay your beneficiary (usually your family) a lump sum when you die for the price of the premium.
- If you outlive your policy, you don't get any money.
- The premium of a term plan does not change (generally) once you have bought a policy.

## What should be the coverage amount I should look for?
- Think of all the expenses that the family has ahead of them.
- Think of the amount of money that they will need to put in a fixed deposit to generate a regular income (to support those expenses)
- Use [[Thumb rule to calculate the life insurance cover amount]]

## When NOT to buy a term cover
- If you have $0$ dependents on your income, you don't need a life insurance, since there will be nobody to miss your income
- If you are [[Meaning of financial freedom|financially free]], you do not need a term cover.

## You can terminate your term insurance
- The job of the life insurance cover is to serve you till you are debt-free and financially independent
- The moment that happens you can stop your term insurance. You lose nothing if you terminate it.

## Additions to life insurance
- [[Insurance cover for loans]]

## When buying a policy
- Policy should be a mix of a cheap plan from a company known to honour its claims
- The premium of the policy gets locked to the price at the time of buying
- **Buy online** - Cheapest, due to absence of agent commission
- Check the claims experience of the insurance firm
	- Claims experience should be more than 95%. This means that the company pays more than 95% of the claims filed.
