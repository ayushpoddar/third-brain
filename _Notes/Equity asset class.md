- Equity is ownership of a business and the risk that it brings, either directly (through stocks) or indirectly (through mutual funds)
- Misunderstood to be gamble - It is a slow cook

## Volatility and its effects
- A large cap index will be more stable than a mid cap index
- Volatility affects those who deal in the stock market for short periods of time
- The longer you allow an index to work, the lower the effect of volatility

## Stocks are the best way to beat inflation
- As inflation rises in the system – the input costs for the firms go up – they are passed on to the consumers in the form of higher final prices. The ‘margins’ or the profits of the firm, therefore, get protection from the effect of input price inflation.

## Ideal timeline for good returns
- Time in the market matters. It smoothens out the volatility of the market
- **Do NOT** put your money into the equity market if you need it next year
- Requires patience - Good equity portfolio needs five years of patience, ten years to see consistent returns, but actually will slow-cook over fifteen to twenty years

## Risk of locking into a single company or asset manager
- The risk in equity investing is not of the market, but of poor fund management.
- Do not invest in any product that locks you into a particular company or asset manager.

### Choose a product where exit is cheap and easy
- **Portability**: You should be able to port your money to a better fund manager for a very tiny cost if you are unhappy with the existing one.
