- Insurance to cover your medical expenses

## Caveats
- The premium of the medical cover changes as we age.

### Exclusions
- A policy will list out diseases, conditions and medical services that it will not cover
	- Dental treatment, pregnancy and cosmetic surgery are standard exclusions


### Sub-limits
- Some policies have in-built limits to what you can spend on what part of a hospital's service.
	- Example: Room rent (when hospitalised) may be limited to a certain amount

### Co-pay
- Some policies will not pay the full amount because of "co-pay"
- Co-pay means that you agree to pay for a part of the medical cost

### Pre-existing disease
- Most insurance companies do not cover your "pre-existing" disease and related medical costs for a maximum of 4 years.

### Disease waiting period
- Many companies have a cool-off period of 30 to 90 days during which they will not pay any claim.
- Some ailments such as cataract or hernia may have a special "waiting period" before the company will pay

## Tips
### For nuclear family
- Buy insurance product called 'family floater' that allows the insurance cover to whichever member of the family that needs it
- Always disclose your correct present and past medical history to the insurance company when you sign up for a policy.

	- Management of the company
	- Its hospital reach
	- Its [[Third-party agent (TPA) service|third party agent (TPA) service]]
	- Its claim experience

### Practical advice
- Try to find answers to the following questions when researching:
	- How does the company perform on the metric of price?
		- How does it compare to the other companies right now?
		- How does the price compare over the years?
			- Ask the agent (Or find out yourself) to show the price comparison at ten-year differences. For example: if you are 40 years old, ask for the price of the policy as it is today when sold to a 50-year, 60-year and 70-year old.
	- How does it perform on the metric of benefits?
		- Ensure that there is no "co-pay" clause
			- In the policy document, search for the words "co-pay". Search the internet to check if the policy has complaints related to co-pay.
		- Check for the "pre-existing" disease clause. Check for the waiting period for pre-existing disease
		- Check if the policy has a "disease waiting period".
			- List out all the diseases that are covered under this clause
			- Try to get a policy that does not have "disease waiting period"
		- Check if the policy has "sub-limits". Try to get a policy with no "sub-limits"
	- How does it perform on the metric of claims?
