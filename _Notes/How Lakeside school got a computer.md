- Bill Dougal was a World War 2 navy pilot turned high school math and science teacher
- He believed that real-world experience was necessary along with book study. Also, he realised that students need to know something about computers when they got to college
- In 1968, he petitioned the Lakeside school Mothers' Club to use the proceeds from its annual rummage sale (about $3000) to lease a Teletype model 30 computer hooked up to the General Electric mainframe terminal for computer time sharing
> The whole idea of time-sharing got invented in 1965
\- Bill Gates
- Lakeside's computer wasn't part of general curriculum. It was an independent study program
