- Money saved for any unplanned emergency.
- This should only be used if all other sources of money have been exhausted

## Amount to target for emergency fund
- 6 months to 2 years of living costs
- Living costs should include each and every expense that happens, including subscriptions, club memberships, etc
- Lower the risk to the household, lower the amount we need to save
	- If you are the sole earner of the family, and you have non-earning dependents (including kids and parents), then you are at **high risk**

## Where to keep the emergency fund
- Best and safest product is **fixed deposit**
- Try to get hold of flexi-FDs that allow you to sweep out a part of the total deposited amount. This will allow you to withdraw just the amount you need, rather than breaking the entire deposit.

### Alternative option - short term debt funds
- If you are familiar with mutual funds, then you can also park the emergency fund in a short term debt fund.
- Choose a conservative fund, not aggressive
- Don't buy a product based on just high returns
- Ensure that the top holding of the debt fund is in AAA-rated bonds

#### Advantages of short term debt fund over FDs
- More liquid than a FD
- Better rate of interest
- Lower tax incidence â†’ Higher post tax return
