## Caution when capturing highlights
- Caution when capturing highlights:
	- Often, we capture things because we think we should even when we don't feel any connection to them
		- This leads to way too much information

## What to do? (Solution)
- Try and capture only information that sparks something inside you

### Main a list of core questions
- Richard Feynman maintained a list of dozen core questions. Again new piece of information he came across, he would test it against these core questions.
	- You should build such a list of core questions
