## Buses
- Electrical conduits running throughout a computer system that transfer bytes back and forth.
- They are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as **words**.

## Word size
- Fundamental system parameter
- Generally, they are either 4-byte (32-bit) or 8-byte (64-bit)
- Size of a CPU register

## Main memory
- Temporary storage that holds both the program code and the data it works on.
- Consists of a collection of **dynamic random access memory (DRAM)** chips.
- Logically, memory is organized as an array of bytes, each with its own unique address (array index) starting at 0.

## Program counter (PC)
- Special register that points at some machine instruction in main memory
- Processor executes the instruction pointed at by the PC and updates the PC to point to the next instruction
