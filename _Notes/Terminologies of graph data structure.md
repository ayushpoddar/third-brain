- **Vertex**: Each node is called a vertex
- **Edge**: Connection between two vertices
- **Path**: The sequence of vertices to go through from traversing from one vertex to another. *There can be multiple paths between two vertices*
- **Path length**: The number of vertices in the path
- **Cycle**: **Path** where the starting vertex and the ending vertex are the same
- **Negative weight cycle**: In a [[Weighted graph data structure|weighted graph]], if the sum of the weights of all edges of a cycle is negative.

- **Connectivity**: If there at least one path between two vertices, then they are said to be **connected**.
- **Degree of a vertex**: In unweighted graphs ([[Undirected graph data structure|undirected graph]] and [[Directed graph data structure|directed graph]]), it is the number of edges connecting the vertex.

- **In-degree**: In [[Directed graph data structure|directed graphs]], it is the number of edges coming into a vertex
![[Pasted image 20230714135100.png|A has an in-degree of 1]]
- **Out-degree**: In [[Directed graph data structure|directed graphs]], it is the number of edges coming out of a vertex
