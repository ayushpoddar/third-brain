## Highlights

As an engineer, we like to solve hard problems and jump into the final design; however, this approach is likely to lead you to design the wrong system. One of the most important skills as an engineer is to ask the right questions, make the proper assumptions, and gather all the information needed to build a system. So, do not be afraid to ask questions.

Here is a list of questions to help you get started:

•   What specific features are we going to build?
    
•   How many users does the product have?
    
•   How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?
    
•   What is the company’s technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?
