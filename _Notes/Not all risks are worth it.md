## Some things are not worth risking
- Things like reputation, love of your loved ones, freedom, happiness are invaluable
- Your best shot at keeping these things is to know when to stop taking risks that might harm them

## No risk should wipe you out
- No risk is worth it if it can wipe you out, even if the odds are heavily stacked in your favor. You need to survive to fight another day when the odds are against you.
