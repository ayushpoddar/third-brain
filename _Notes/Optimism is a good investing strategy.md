- The world, in general, tends to get better in the long run. Hence, optimism is the best bet.

## Defining optimism
- Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people wake up in the morning trying to make things a little better and more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is the foundation of optimism. It’s not complicated. It’s not guaranteed, either.

## Pessimism is given more importance than optimism
- Pessimism sounds smarter and hence, is given more importance than optimism.
	- It is the way humans have evolved.
	- When directly compared or weighed against each other, losses loom larger than gains.
	- Progress happens slowly. Setbacks happen too quickly to ignore

## Extremes don't survive
- Extremely good or bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long because the market (supply and demand) adapt in hard-to-predict ways to bring everything near balance.
