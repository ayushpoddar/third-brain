- Each of your goals need their own asset allocation ratio
- Closer you are to the goal, lesser should be the equity part of the portfolio

## Short-term goals (<3 years)
- No pure equity products
- Recommended products are similar to that for emergency fund
- You could also use ultra-short-term debt fund or conservative hybrid mutual funds
- Keep maximum equity exposure to 25% and keep the rest in bonds. **Why?**
	- Because equity is volatile and we want certainty about the availability of the money

## Medium term goals (3-7 years)
- Aggressive hybrid mutual funds
- Diversified equity funds

## Medium-long term goals (7-10 years)
- Mix of more or less aggressive equity
- Mutli-cap funds with a smaller proportion of mid-cap, small-cap and sector funds

## Long term goals (>10 years)
- 100% equity
- Increase the proportion of mid and small cap funds
- Largest part of the equity fund portfolio must remain in lower-risk diversified equity or multi-cap mutual funds

## Retirement fund
- Core is your [[Debt asset class|debt products]]
- Rest of your portfolio can be in equity funds
- Further away from retirement you are, the more risk you can take
	- People in 30s can choose a larger allocation to mid-cap, small-cap and sector funds
	- People in 40s should choose conservative funds with large-cap, diversified equity and multi-cap funds
- [[Evaluating your retirement portfolio]] periodically. The frequency can be quarterly to annually based on your situtation.
