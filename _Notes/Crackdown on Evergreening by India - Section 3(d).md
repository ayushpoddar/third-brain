- In 2005, to counter [[Evergreening of patents by pharma companies|evergreening of patents by pharma companies]], the government of India tweaked the Patent Act, 1970.
- A new section, **Section 3(d)** was inserted which said:
> mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any new property or new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus unless such known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant **cannot be given patent protection**

## Example of its implementation
