- Avoid extreme ends of financial planning
- Try to maintain balance at every point of the financial strategy.
	- This will help avoid future regret and encourage endurance
	- Will allow compounding to work its magic. Compounding works in almost all areas like finance, career, relationships, etc.

## Example
- Assuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point of regret.
