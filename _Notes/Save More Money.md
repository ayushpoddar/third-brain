- Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns.
- It has lots to do with your savings rate

## The rationale behind this
- Investment returns and strategies are always in doubt. They can make you rich, sure. But the results are uncertain.
- Personal savings are parts of personal finance that are more in our control and have an almost 100% chance of being effective in the future as they are today

> [!important] Lower expenses = High savings rate
