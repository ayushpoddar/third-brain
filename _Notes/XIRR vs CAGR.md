## CAGR
- Compounded annualized growth rate (CAGR) is the year-on-year compounded growth. In other words, it is the annual compound interest.

### Example
- Example: If the value of an investment of Rs 12,000 is Rs 22,991 after 5 years, we can evaluate the CAGR as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
22991 &= 12000 * (1 + \text{CAGR})^{5} \\
\text{CAGR} &= 13.9\%
\end{align}
$$

## XIRR
- Extended internal rate of return (XIRR) is a measure of return used when multiple investments are made at different points of time
- When multiple investments are made, the CAGR is different for each investment.
- In case of XIRR, each investment is perceived to grow at the same CAGR.
- Thus, XIRR is the common adjusted CAGR at which all investments are perceived to grow

### Example
Assuming, an annual SIP of Rs 12,000 for 12 years, this is the respective CAGR that we get:
