- It is important to know much wealth is enough for you to lead a "good" life

> There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.

## "Enough" is not too little
- The idea of "enough" might look like conservatism. It is NOT!
- It is realizing that the opposite - the insatiable appetite for more - will push you to the point of regret

## No unnecessary risks
- Don't try to outperform the market if you can meet all your goals without having to take the added risk that comes from trying to outperform.
