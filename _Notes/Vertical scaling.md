- Process of adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc) to the servers
- Also referred as "scale up"
- Good option when traffic is low

## Advantages
- Simplicity

## Disadvantages
- Has a hard limit in terms of the hardware available
	- Impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server
- No failover and redundancy
	- If one server goes down, the website/app goes down with it completely
- If many users access the web server simultaneously and it reaches the web server's load limit, users will experience slower response or fail to connect
- Overall cost of vertical scaling is high. Powerful servers are much more expensive
