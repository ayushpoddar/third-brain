- In 1960s, Honeywell in partnership with **Bell Laboratories** started working on the **Multics** operating system.
- In 1969, Bell Laboratories dropped out of the project due to the increasing complexity of the project and the lack of progress
- 1969 -> In reaction to this unpleasant experience, a group of Bell Labs researchers - **Ken Thompson**, **Dennis Ritchie**, **Doug McIlroy** and **Joe Ossana** began working on a simpler operating system for a digital equipment corporation **PDP-7 computer**, written entirely in machine language.
- Many of the ideas in the new system like hierarchical file system and the notion of a user-level process were borrowed from **Multics**
- In 1970, **Brian Kernighan** dubbed the new system **Unix** as a pun on the word - Multics.
- The kernel of Unix was rewritten in C in 1973.
- Unix was announced to the outside world in 1974.

## About POSIX
- In mid 1980s, different vendors started coming up with their own versions of Unix to differentiate themselves.
	- These versions, however, were often incompatible with each other.
- To combat this trend, IEEE sponsored an effort to standardise Unix. This was dubbed as **POSIX** by **Richard Stallman**
- This resulted in a family of standards known as **Posix standards**.
	- It covered issues such as C language interface for Unix system calls, shell programs and utilities, threads, and network programming

### Recent developments (Standard Unix specification)
- Recently, a separate standard effort has started known as **Standard Unix Specification**
- It has joined hands with Posix to create a single, unified standard for Unix systems.
