- Luck and risk are two sides of the same coin. At any point in life, life can flip any side at you.
- They influence every outcome in life
- Cannot believe in one without respecting the other
- The accidental impact of actions outside of our control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take
- We should be more forgiving to ourselves when we fail, because of the role that risk plays
	- And vise-versa. We should be more humble when we succeed. We don't know the impact luck had in our success
- Its extremely difficult to identify what is luck and what is skill
	- And what is risk

> [!important] 100% of outcomes cannot be attributed to effort, skills and decisions
