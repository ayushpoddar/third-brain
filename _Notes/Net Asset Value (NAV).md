- Price of a unit of a scheme
- Not 'gross', because the costs have been removed from the price. You get the net value in hand

## Example
- 100 investors.
- Each has invested Rs 1000 in the fund
- Each bought a unit for the price of Rs 10 - each investor holds 100 units
- Total invested value of the fund: Rs 1 lakh
- A year later, the mutual fund becomes worth Rs 1.5 lakh giving a profit of Rs 50,000
- Assume that the fund costs are Rs 10,000, then the net profit is Rs 40,000
- Thus, the NAV becomes Rs 14 from Rs 10.
- Multiplying the NAV with the number of units in the fund gives your fund return. In this case, each investor's invested value increases from Rs 1000 to Rs 1400.
