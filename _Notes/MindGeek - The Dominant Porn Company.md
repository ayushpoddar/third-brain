- Based in Montreal
- Owner of several popular sites like Pornhub, RedTube and YouPorn
- Owner - [[Bernard Bergemar]]

## Operations

## Secretiveness of the company
- It has very little scrutiny or accountability
- MindGeek and [[Bernard Bergemar|Mr Bergemar]] have remained largely in the shadows.
	- Its early lenders such as JP Morgan have also made sure to hide from view

## Modest profits
- As per its recents accounts in 2018, MindGeek had made only modest profits.
- Pre-tax profit reached $38.3m in 2018, up from $9.7m in 2017 and $26m the year before, with net revenues hovering just under $500m

### Reason for the modest profits
- The interest on the loan received by Thylmann is a major culprit
	- It has paid an annual 20.4 per cent interest rate on outstanding debt that in 2018 reached $370m.
- Money is also funnelled into a complex network of subsidiaries that MindGeek owns less than a third of and in which Mr Bergemar holds a significant set of shares, according to a person close to the company.
