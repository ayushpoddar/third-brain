## Free Software Movement by Richard Stallman
- Grew out of the related, but separate, "free software" movement
- In 1983, Richard Stallman - a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory - said he would create a free alternative to the Unix operating system (then owned by AT&T).
	- He called this alternative - **GNU (GNU's Not Unix)**
- He released his code under the [[GNU Public License (GPL)]] - which also allowed companies to sell software based on GNU

## Linux Kernel released by Linus Torvalds
- Linus Torvalds - a Finnish programmer - created the [[About Linux|Linux operating system]] in 1991.
- GNU lacked a finished kernel at the time. So, many GNU users combined GNU and Linux into a functional operating system. These bundles became known as GNU/Linux distributions.

## Clash of ideals - Birth of "Open Source"
- Tensions grew between people like Stallman, who believed that all software should be free on ethical grounds, and more business-oriented developers who thought that freely sharing code was a better way to build software but not an ethical imperative.
- In 1998, a group met to discuss how to promote the idea of shared code and open collaboration. The group settled on the label "open source" - coined by Christine Peterson - to distinguish its aims
