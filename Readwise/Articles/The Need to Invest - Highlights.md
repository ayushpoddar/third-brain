- Fixed-income instruments are investment avenues where your principal amount (the money you invest) is perceived to be safe. The entity pays an interest amount on the principal you invest. The bank’s fixed deposit scheme is the simplest example of a fixed investment instrument. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h11tw9gqwf08sq0kdyb36x6n))

- The Govt bonds are considered the safest investment, with zero risk to your investment, because, well, the govt can’t cheat and run away with your money. Corporate bonds are risky, though; investment in corporate bonds can go to zero, and we have seen plenty of such examples in the past.

    - Note: Ways to invest in gold
- It is best if your investments have a mix of all asset classes. It is wise to diversify your investment among the various asset classes. The technique of allocating money across asset classes is termed ‘Asset Allocation’, and we will discuss asset allocation later in Varsity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h11v96xsdnfz5wjps4a8x8h1))
- Typically investors should allocate at least 60% of their investable amount in equity, 20% in precious metals, and 20% in fixed-income investments. The percentage mix changes based on risk profile and age. For example, a retired person could invest 80% in fixed income (Govt bonds maybe), 10% in equity markets, and 10% in precious metals.
