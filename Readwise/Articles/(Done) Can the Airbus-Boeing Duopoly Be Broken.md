- in 1916 when Boeing began its journey as an Aero Products Company. At first, they supplied military aircraft to meet the needs of World War I. They were also ferrying mail on the side since it was quite profitable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmzp8w3vx8mdqkq6y6jhypbt))

- These aren’t mass-produced. Airbus and Boeing wait for orders and then start putting the planes together. They also need to set up massive manufacturing facilities to meet the growing needs of commercial aviation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmzpdahx5n2a3knfbk205qy9))
