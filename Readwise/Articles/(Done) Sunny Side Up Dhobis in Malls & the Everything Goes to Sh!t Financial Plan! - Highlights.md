## Highlights
- Which is why former RBI governor, Dr Bimal Jain introduced a ‚Äò[Clean Note Policy](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/50050.pdf)‚Äô in 1999 to suck out soiled notes from circulation and issue fresh or clean notes. 2 years later the RBI even urged banks to use bands instead of [stapling notes](https://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/Scripts/PressReleases.aspx?Id=137#:~:text=Clean%20Note%20Policy%3A%20RBI&text=The%20objective%20of%20the%20Reserve,are%20withdrawn%20out%20of%20circulation.) to increase their life.

- Well, some [mall operators](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/come-to-the-mall-and-bring-your-chores-along/articleshow/96804555.cms) have caught on to this idea. And they‚Äôre diversifying their tenants now. They‚Äôre roping in tailors, cobblers, pet groomers, launderers and even pop-up health labs so that people don‚Äôt skip mall visits and run helter-skelter to finish their errands.

- 1. ¬†A fixed fee is charged from the tenant. So they‚Äôll make money irrespective of whether stores make good sales or not. But if malls don‚Äôt woo customers and sales remain flat, then there‚Äôs a high chance of brands closing down their mall stores. The mall could turn into a ‚Äòghost‚Äô mall ‚Äî with low footfall and high vacancy. And they‚Äôll lose revenue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpzxse7kvnqszgn9fawv7tnh))

- Well, it took 100 years, but [Alfred Marshall](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/frbsf/frbsf_let/frbsf_let_19921204.pdf) finally cracked the paradox and put the debate to rest.

- In simple terms, the first litre of water is precious. It will quench your thirst. But what will you do with another 5 litres of water? You could store it for use but the more water you have, the less you start valuing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpzy2wwvexrcyhp1qm1aj2z5))

- But that‚Äôs not the case with diamonds. Each additional diamond has the same allure. No one says no to the extra bling. You put this and its scarcity together and boom, you have a high price! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpzy373xv7devea8bhmfg4pv))
