## Highlights
- See, [in 1976](https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-age-of-customer-capitalism), capitalism changed forever. Two researchers published a paper titled ‘Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure’ in the Journal of Financial Economics. The authors believed that professional managers who ran companies were only concerned about themselves. They didn’t care about the real owners — the shareholders.

- People took notice of this paper. Especially CEOs who were just starting to stamp their authority. All of them swore up and down that the most important thing a business could do was to maximise shareholder wealth. And two people who lived and breathed this credo were [Roberto Goizueta of Coca-Cola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Goizueta) and [Jack Welch of General Electric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch). Both of them took the over in 1981 and flipped things around. They focused on shareholder wealth — The era of **‘shareholder capitalism’** had begun.

- Anyway, since a large part of CEO compensation is tied to stock prices, they too make choices that focus on this one metric. Ones that are invariably short-sighted. Like layoffs which create an optical illusion of efficiency but don’t seem to actually help in the long run. And when shareholders celebrate and stock prices jump on such announcements, they believe that it’s the correct decision. Even if hard data says otherwise.

- Stanford professor [Jeffrey Pfeffer](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/) calls it social contagion**.**
  And it’s a fairly provocative idea because he’s essentially saying, “Look, companies have a massive amount of data on their hands when it comes to hiring. And firing. But, when it comes to actually making decisions, they just copy what peers are doing.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxv2nw2dx48ms84cavwy8jn))
- So there you go. The dirty secret behind these layoffs could simply include — **shareholder capitalism and social contagion**! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxv4kv3628xqnx8j1bkz8md))
