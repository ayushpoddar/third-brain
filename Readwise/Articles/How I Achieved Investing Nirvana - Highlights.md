## Highlights
- In case the liquid corpus depletes completely and more equity investment is needed, I plan to take out money from my PPF account (which is more than 15 years old. Though till now, that situation has not materialized). Coming to index funds, I have investments only in 3 funds – N50, NN50 and MidCap (all direct plans). While making fresh investments, I invest such that the ratio among the three funds is maintained at 70:20:10 (Which I believe closely mimics a hypothetical N250 index fund. Correct me if I am wrong).

- No FDs, no RDs, no NPS, no VPF, no debt funds, no gold, no direct equity, no active funds, no SIPs, no RE and thankfully, no crypto. I have retained my holding in only one stock I purchased many years ago (It’s done well over the years) and also have a small amount of gold that I had purchased earlier. However, I am not making any fresh additions to these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h02na5n229xh05rq0ymn7bz2))
