- Under present international laws, there are few legal options available to such migrants since it is not always possible to pin down climatic reasons as the primary cause of migration. As per the 1951 Refugee Convention, legal protection is afforded only to those fleeing their home “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion”.
