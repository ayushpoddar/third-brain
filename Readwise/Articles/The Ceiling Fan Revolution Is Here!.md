## Highlights
- [88% of Indian households](http://rn619dmj.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/http:%2F%2Frchiips.org%2Fnfhs%2FNFHS-5Reports%2FNFHS-5_INDIA_REPORT.pdf/1/0100018528b0d6b6-c28617b1-9bf1-4bcf-b60c-1e84ba06ec30-000000/sKCZqMhLRmYGdnFZLsi-aptIVV0=300) own an electric fan. Only 72% of them own a mattress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtf79ye5s2d6fkerjat6kry))
- As a consequence, only 3 out of 100 households use fans that are energy efficient. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtf8ghfedqf96zxw7wqcvv1))
- Now here’s the thing…fans account for nearly 25% of a household’s electricity consumption. So if your standard electricity bill adds up to ₹1000, your fans will contribute nearly ₹250. You’re shelling out more than you should just by using outdated tech. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtf9rd55y8k96bjen5p989d))
- But that’s set to change from the 1st of January 2023. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is putting its foot down. It’s revamping the system. And from now on, ceiling fans will have to display their star ratings. It’ll help people make more informed choices. And so we could see super-efficient (SE) fans finally gain popularity.

- Okay, so a conventional fan uses something called an induction motor and consumes about 75 W at top speed. But an SE fan is more  advanced — it uses something called the brushless direct current (BLDC) motor. And at top speed, it consumes just 35 W of energy.

- Also, a conventional fan has more moving parts. Things like commutators and brushes. And over the years they succumb to mechanical wear and tear. A BLDC fan meanwhile has none of that. So it has a longer life. And it can save you a lot of money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtfaknf7xpqdwt30xqkpr2g))
- Well, state governments often subsidise the cost of electricity. For instance, in [Delhi](https://www.cnbctv18.com/india/delhi-free-electricity-subsidy-last-date-to-apply-extended-till-november-15-here-is-how-to-apply-15108641.htm) , the government offers free electricity to those who consume just 200 units per month. And a few researchers [believe that](https://rn619dmj.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.hindustantimes.com%2Fht-insight%2Feconomy%2Fbusiness-model-for-scaling-up-super-efficient-appliances-101648893554233.html%255C/2/0100018528b0d6b6-c28617b1-9bf1-4bcf-b60c-1e84ba06ec30-000000/KViTYuoQqPK6k4Z-sVD9DviI000=300) state governments could save nearly ₹575 crores in subsidies if every home in India replaces conventional fan with an SE fan. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtfbgv6g89kcq3gjkh6z9ae))
    - Note: Governments will benefit by BLDC fans too
- You see, BLDC fans cost twice as much as conventional fans. So people will probably need a nudge to make that shift. The energy and cost savings won’t be quite apparent at the start and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency may have to improve awareness before they start making a big dent.
