## Highlights
- Besides lump-sums, the RATE function can also give the returns for regular, periodic investments such as mutual fund SIPs. It can even be used to find the interest rate that you pay on loans. In essence, it helps you arrive at the CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of investments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp1wfrqhs4p44yktyys2prrp))

- You can use the FV function—short for future value—to calculate this value instantly. It can also be used to find the maturity value in periodic investments like mutual fund SIPs and recurring deposits.

- You can use the NPER function to arrive at this figure. NPER is short for Number of Periods.
  This function can also help find the quantum of time in which regular, constant investments—such as recurring deposits or mutual fund SIPs—would grow to your desired corpus at a particular rate of return. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp1wmxf3dh2ka2w5nk0793jz))
