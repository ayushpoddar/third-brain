## Highlights
- In 2015, the present government took the old solar mission of 2010 under its wings and set an audacious target—to have 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022, with 40% coming from rooftop solar. This would mean clocking a 27X growth in solar capacity in just seven years, from just 3.7 GW at the end of 2015. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfcgn61wkjk7rwtjryt7dny))

- In December 2022, however, when the minister for new and renewable energy placed a written reply before Parliament, it was apparent India had fallen short of the goal—by about 38%. Against the target of 100 GW, [installed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/india-achieves-166gw-of-renewable-energy-capacity-till-october/96086448) solar power capacity as of October 2022 stood at just 61.6 GW.

- Among other things, they [customers] had an alternate solution coming from coal, gas or hydro, something which was more dependable and cheaper. In green hydrogen, today users are in large industries like steel, refineries, glass and fertilisers, where companies have an option to produce hydrogen through other means, grey or blue, and where cost differential with green hydrogen will be large. Customer demand will be an issue again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfcw10b63t5jgv3k8z2tw79))
