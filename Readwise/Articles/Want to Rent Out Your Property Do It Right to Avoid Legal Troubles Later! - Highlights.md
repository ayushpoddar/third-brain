- • Decide if you wish to let out to a family or a business establishment (if such a choice applies to the property). It may be hard to make a business vacate since the address would be tied up with their GST, PAN etc. When possible, rent out only to those with good references from friends or family. Use a broker only as a last resort. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2xbakezkm6dsdydgzpw3513))
- Do not type the rental lease on your own and execute it. Seek the services of a law firm experienced in rent cases and ask them to draft one. They will ensure there are no loopholes and ensure the wording is up to date, taking into account recent judgements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2xbbafy2s5b37r9kc3va2t8))
- Register the lease with the state rental authority. This is a crucial step in validating the lease. If this is not done, there can be trouble later if the tenant refuses to vacate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2xbbndw60e9t5vkcem6g248))
- Ensure that a reminder is sent at least a month in advance to get the lease renewed (if you desire). Typical leases are 11 months in duration. Get the new lease whetted by the law firm and re-register with the rental authority. At any point, the tenant’s use of your property must be backed by a valid lease.
