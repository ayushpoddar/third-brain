## Highlights
- $200 billion.
  That’s the kind of money Qatar is estimated to have spent in the run-up to the World Cup. They built massive expressways, subsea tunnels, state-of-the-art hospitals, swanky hotels, and upgraded their airports. The whole shebang!
  For context, Russia spent just $16 billion in 2018. Brazil — about $20 billion in 2014. And South Africa sunk $7 billion in 2010 to get everything in order ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtf52dn3m5sj4qyewq5rbk5))
- For instance, TV broadcasting rights were estimated at $2.64 billion. But that money didn’t go to Qatar. It went to FIFA. Okay, what about ticket sales? Well, that’s run by a company that’s 100% owned by FIFA, so Qatar doesn’t see a penny here also. Then there are the operational costs associated with running the tournament — about $1.7 billion. FIFA bears this cost but Qatar gets this money. However, the country has to set aside ~$450 million just for prizes. So this isn’t a money spinner either.

- Well, there’s a larger goal in mind here — Qatar’s grand [national vision for 2030](https://rn619dmj.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.gco.gov.qa%2Fen%2Fabout-qatar%2Fnational-vision2030%2F/1/0100018532ff8bac-769d5367-761b-42eb-b0f1-b1867ffe1794-000000/xR5gJSPBg2bYcVZZB9INOz_L4eg=301) . During the 2008 financial crisis, Qatar woke up to the harsh realities of running an economy built on oil money. Some day they’re going to run out of reserves. Or perhaps countries will transition to cleaner fuels. So they needed to make the country more attractive. Take a leaf out of Saudi Arabia or UAE’s playbook and become a global destination. Spend big money on infrastructure and build out a future that’s more appealing to international visitors and businesses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtf5emwvf9dg3pb11em7xq5))
- Well, we said ‘bid’. So here’s a little [secret](https://rn619dmj.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fwonk%2Fwp%2F2015%2F06%2F02%2Fwhy-countries-that-fight-to-host-the-world-cup-are-wasting-their-time%2F/1/0100018532ff8bac-769d5367-761b-42eb-b0f1-b1867ffe1794-000000/TIGmJxK6x9ktWfeGDimVvCx3h_c=301) . A few economists looked at the numbers and found that if a country simply placed a bid for a tournament, it helped them nonetheless. They didn’t have to even win it. They didn’t have to lobby hard for it. The bid alone would get companies thinking, “Hey, this country is pretty serious about hosting a global tournament. Maybe this is going to become a global destination. Maybe we could set up shop here too.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtf5vc34dvgxmzx2f1hgxf2))
