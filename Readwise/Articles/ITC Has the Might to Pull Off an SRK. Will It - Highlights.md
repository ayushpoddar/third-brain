## Highlights
- I couldn’t help comparing it with tobacco and FMCG giant ITC, because on the day the movie released (25 January), the company [unveiled](https://www.thehindu.com/business/itc-unveils-mission-millets-for-food-security/article66433610.ece) “Mission Millet”—a campaign to mainstream the grain in India and centered around food and nutritional security.

- First, with wider reach, more millets will get consumed. This is what India desperately wants given that 65% of net cropped area in the country is rain-fed—farmers growing this short-duration crop will reduce their farming risk.

- Aashirvaad and Sunfeast are ITC’s biggest brands even today. They accounted for Rs 6,000 crore (US$830 million) and Rs 4,000 crore (US$550 million), respectively, in consumer spend for the year ended March 2020 , according to the company’s annual report. ITC hasn’t released any more recent break-ups, but for the year ended March 2022, total consumer spending across its brands stood at Rs 24,000 crore (~US$2.9 billion).

- Before India front-and-centred millet as a nutri-cereal, a major thrust area in its [2022 Union Budget](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-gives-fillip-to-revive-millet-cultivation-in-state-101643914029071.html) , it got a bunch of large private companies and agriculture institutions to prepare a white paper on the scope and opportunities for popularising this “super food”.

- From the nutrition point of view, says Raj Seelam, the bulk of our calories today come from wheat and rice, even though millets have higher proteins, fibre, minerals, and beneficial phytochemicals. “Most [varieties] of millets have lower glycaemic index. One millet meal a day is great for dietary diversification and reducing incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs2g9z114dcsj992gj9vd1gd))
