- There are many ways to assign weights, but the Indian stock exchange follows a **free-float market capitalization method.** The weights are assigned based on the company’s free-float market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the higher the weight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13qxyzxs3aeh5g87c79dek3))

  For example, company ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50, then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs.5,000 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13qybnyt4swzh52vj87s2zr))
