- If you were expecting the [trend of sachetisation](https://rn619dmj.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Ftheprint.in%2Fpageturner%2Fexcerpt%2Fcavinkare-shampoo-sachet-that-was-the-true-pioneer-of-middle-india-market%2F1209049%2F/1/01000185c3354386-4e5308c2-be6d-43ac-b999-4acdedaa2617-000000/hxmtd9B-CmcG8JuvRADX_jUOocI=305) to emerge from a gigantic corporation run by MBAs, you’d be dead wrong. It actually began in the small town of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu 50 years ago.

And after some ground research, he found that most folks in rural areas would have to spend around ₹8–10 a month to clean their hair. It wasn’t economical.
