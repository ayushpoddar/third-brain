## Highlights
- The face value of a stock or bond does not denote the actual [market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp), which is determined based on principles of supply and demand--often governed by the dollar figure at which investors are willing to buy and sell a particular security, at a specific point in time. In fact, depending on market conditions, the face value and market value may have very little correlation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1h53d9hwg9nyhf3tzmdh7eb))
- While face value is the original price of a stock as set by its issuer, market value is influenced by external supply-and-demand forces. Market value is the price that the market will bear, and it can differ significantly from a stockâ€™s initial price. For example, the face value of Apple shares is $0.00001, while the market value of its shares can fluctuate above $100. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1h53sz3pb641vnvjyfa30w3))
