Sure, municipal corporations or other government departments [sponsor](https://rn619dmj.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.boomlive.in%2Fexplainers%2Ftaj-mahal-property-tax-water-bill-asi-20526/1/0100018547997ced-924aabec-e764-45e5-b78f-8342f072169d-000000/NlXxRd2Y2DyuZFVrg97YOGJzdHI=301) the monument’s light bills sometimes. But mostly, it’s the ASI that pays. The ASI is a government agency that has a distinct identity from the ministry itself.

Hold on, don’t scoff at this technique just yet. Mindful spending means spending with purpose. Every time you take out your wallet or add a thing to your shopping cart, ask yourself if it aligns with your long-term goals. If you need it ASAP, sure, go ahead and make that purchase.

Alternatively, you could also take some time out this weekend to match how your spending aligns with your values and goals. What do you want to spend money on? And why do you want to do it?
