## Highlights
- Like the EPF, the VPF has an implicit government guarantee—ergo, it scores the maximum on safety.
- The VPF enjoys the same rates as the EPF.
- the 8.1% declared by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) for the year ended March 2022 applies to VPF too
- The amount invested is eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C, up to Rs 1.5 lakh (US$1,800) a year. The interest earned is exempt from tax too (up to a limit, anyway. But more on this below). And so is the maturity amount. So, the post-tax return on the EPF and VPF is far higher than from bank deposits, where the interest is taxable.
- From the fiscal year that ended March 2022, if an employee puts more than Rs 2.5 lakh (US$3,000) a year into their EPF account (including VPF), the interest on the excess contribution above Rs 2.5 lakh is taxable.
- before putting the additional money in the VPF, exhaust tax-exempt options like the PPF (max Rs 1.5 lakh a year); these could yield better post-tax returns than the incremental investment in the VPF.
