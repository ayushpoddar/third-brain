- It’s the ‘Rule of 72’
  Gives the compound annual rate
  At which a rupee grows to two
  Just divide 72
  With the number of years
  Here, 72/10 is the answer

- if your rupee in 10 years
  Grows from one to three
  That’s 11.4% a year
  ‘Rule of 114’, you’ll see
  Just divide 114
  By the number of years
  Here, 114/10 does the trick
  We don’t need any seers

- if your rupee in 10 years
  Grows from one to four
  That’s a cool 14.4% p.a.
  By the ‘Rule of 144’ 
  Simply divide 144 
  By the number of years
  Here, 144/10 works like magic

- They also work in reverse
  The Rules of 144, 114, and  72
  So, if you know the rate
  In a jiffy, you’ll find the period too
  So, if at 8% per annum
  Your money grows and doubles
  It would take 9 years
    - Note: dividing 72 by 8
