## Highlights
- It works, almost everywhere, on every occasion. And this isn’t a by product of chance. Chocolate is meant to make us feel better. For instance, it contains tryptophan — a type of amino acid that can aid serotonin production. Serotonin by the way is a neurotransmitter that can make you happy.

- Chocolate also contains something called phenylethylamine — a natural antidepressant. And it has theobromine — a compound known to relieve stress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1hfkexfj4vevnc17bpswhzx))
- So even during an impending recession, you need to hold on to something to keep yourself from feeling low and despondent. And for a lot of people, it’s self-care that fits the bill. It helps maintain sanity! And much like beauty products, chocolates can be a perfect fix when you’re feeling blue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1hfpwsr6tsk1k8dtynzcz0r))
- But when a research firm looked at recent data from the US, they saw something else. The demand [elasticity for chocolate](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/09/business/chocolate-sales-ctrp/index.html) stood at -0.4. Meaning that a 10% increase in price resulted in only a 4% drop in sales by volume. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1hfq8zd7azd043gng1kfta1))
- Also, finding a close substitute for chocolate can be hard. You could argue that ice cream is a good replacement. But it’s not an all-weather comforter like a bar of chocolate. Also, other types of Indian sweets can’t induce the happiness and highs, chocolate can produce. Their molecular chemistry is different.

- But things could change. The chocolate effect could die out. Especially in the western world. The per capita chocolate consumption in Europe and the US is already upwards of 7 kg per year. There’s not a lot of room for growth especially if people are turning health-conscious. Also, while the market continues to expand, the rate of growth is slowing.

- So chocolate makers are eyeing unexploited territories. For instance, they’re looking at countries such as India which has a per capita chocolate consumption of a tiny [140 gms](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-chocolate-exception-explained-11670587901485.html). To capture a larger share of this market, in 2016, Mondelez spent [$190 million](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/mondelez-opens-its-largest-plant-in-apac-at-andhra-pradeshs-sri-city/articleshow/51979971.cms?from=mdr) to open its biggest Asia-based chocolate factory in Andhra Pradesh. And today, even Blas Maquivar, head of global emerging markets at Mars Wrigley says and [we quote](https://www.ft.com/content/2e574ffb-c98c-4eb0-a3dc-ce2490f87f2c), “If you go to India, you go to Mexico right now, you will see new offerings [from] us that are playing at the lower price point that didn’t exist [before].” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1hft1c3f6kkx2684trgs8a9))
