## Highlights
- For goals less than 5 years away: no equity exposure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2wpp9d6494svvnfhjrd0zn2))
- Between 5-10 years: Not more than 40% for an important goal and about 60% for a less important goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2wppfabebrx6fryqt9cq0cv))
- Between 10-15 years: 40-60% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2wppjv9r8vfp1vj86k63gnm))
- Above 15 years: 60%. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2wppnp1fwtwd6tjaxwkdjaf))
- Above 15Y, I expect no more than 10-12% from equity. Anything above 14% is nuts.
  Between 10-15Y, 10%
  Below 10Y, 8%.
  For debt, just the post-tax return from FD for the duration you have in mind: 6-7%. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2wpq88a75v5r4ybzb5mt8t2))
- Equity exposure: 60%. Return expected 12%
  Debt exposure: 40%. Return expected 7%.
  So the portfolio return = (60% x 12%) + (40% x 7%) = 10% (after tax). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2wpqnbc9nyhey81nyp9cp3c))
