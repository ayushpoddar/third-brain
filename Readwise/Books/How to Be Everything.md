## Highlights
- Think about each of your priority projects one at a time. Don’t go over all the tasks you need to accomplish. Instead, focus on the big picture. If you are building a T-shirt business, imagine how you will feel on the day you launch or make your first sale.

    - Note: Visualize
- Connecting and Consuming activities can be combined, but should never be combined with Creating. ([Location 2249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01JFYVWLW&location=2249))
- If you find that people are choosing specialists over you despite the fact that you can do the work just as well, you might not be explaining your value effectively. Whether you’re in a job interview or writing copy for your website, focus on how you will solve clients’ problems, on what you can do for them.

- Your project is weird. I don’t mean that in a bad way. The idea is just very different from what the judges will be used to seeing. Don’t hide that weirdness; feature it. ([Location 2573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01JFYVWLW&location=2573))
