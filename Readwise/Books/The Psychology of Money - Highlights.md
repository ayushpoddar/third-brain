- Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money.

    - Note: Story start
^rwID-453483608
- His specialty was patients with severe neurosyphilis—then a fatal diagnosis with no known treatment. He began noticing a pattern: syphilis patients tended to recover if they had the added misfortune of having prolonged fevers from an unrelated ailment. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1257))
^rwID-453483609
- In the early 1900s Wagner-Jauregg began injecting patients with low-end strains of typhoid, malaria, and smallpox to trigger fevers strong enough to kill off their syphilis. ([Location 1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1261))
^rwID-453483610
- He eventually settled on a weak version of malaria, since it could be effectively countered with quinine after a few days of bone-rattling fevers. After some tragic trial and error his experiment worked. Wagner-Jauregg reported that 6 in 10 syphilis patients treated with “malariotherapy” recovered, compared to around 3 in 10 patients left alone. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1263))
^rwID-453483611
- won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1927. The organization today notes: “The main work that concerned Wagner-Jauregg throughout his working life was the endeavour to cure mental disease by inducing a fever.”33 ([Location 1266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1266))

- Penicillin eventually made malariotherapy for syphilis patients obsolete, ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1268))
^rwID-453483613
- Fevers have always been as feared as they are mysterious. Ancient Romans worshiped Febris, the Goddess who protected people from fevers. Amulets were left at temples to placate her, hoping to stave off the next round of shivers. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1270))
^rwID-453483614
- A one-degree increase in body temperature has been shown to slow the replication rate of some viruses by a factor of 200. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1273))
^rwID-453483615
- Fever is almost universally seen as a bad thing. They’re treated with drugs like Tylenol to reduce them as quickly as they appear. Despite millions of years of evolution as a defense mechanism, no parent, no patient, few doctors, and certainly no drug company views fever as anything but a misfortune that should be eliminated. ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1279))
^rwID-453483616
- “Treatment of fever is common in the ICU setting and likely related to standard dogma rather than evidence-based practice.”36 Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine, ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1282))
^rwID-453483617
- If fevers are beneficial, why do we fight them so universally? I don’t think it’s complicated: Fevers hurt. And people don’t want to hurt. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1286))
^rwID-453483618
- A doctor’s goal is not just to cure disease. It’s to cure disease within the confines of what’s reasonable and tolerable to the patient. Fevers can have marginal benefits in fighting infection, but they hurt. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1288))
^rwID-453483619
- It may be rational to want a fever if you have an infection. But it’s not reasonable. ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1291))
^rwID-453483620
- people do not want the mathematically optimal strategy. They want the strategy that maximizes for how well they sleep at night. ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1295))
^rwID-453483621
- Harry Markowitz won the Nobel Prize for exploring the mathematical tradeoff between risk and return. ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1296))
^rwID-453483622
- described his portfolio allocation in the 1950s, when his models were first developed: I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it—or if it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So I split my contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1297))
    - Note: Even he could not be rtional about his portfolio
^rwID-453483623
- One is that “minimizing future regret” is hard to rationalize on paper but easy to justify in real life. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1301))
^rwID-453483624
- A rational investor makes decisions based on numeric facts. A reasonable investor makes them in a conference room surrounded by co-workers you want to think highly of you, with a spouse you don’t want to let down, or judged against the silly but realistic competitors that are your brother-in-law, your neighbor, and your own personal doubts. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1302))
^rwID-453483625
- if lacking emotions about your strategy or the stocks you own increases the odds you’ll walk away from them when they become difficult, what looks like rational thinking becomes a liability. The reasonable investors who love their technically imperfect strategies have an edge, because they’re more likely to stick with those strategies. ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1326))
^rwID-453483626
- There are few financial variables more correlated to performance than commitment to a strategy during its lean years—both the amount of performance and the odds of capturing it over a given period of time. ([Location 1328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1328))
^rwID-453483627
- people prefer to invest in companies from the country they live in while ignoring the other 95%+ of the planet. It’s not rational, until you consider that investing is effectively giving money to strangers. If familiarity helps you take the leap of faith required to remain backing those strangers, it’s reasonable. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1341))
^rwID-460567644
- “We do some things for family reasons,” Bogle told The Wall Street Journal. “If it’s not consistent, well, life isn’t always consistent.” ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1354))
