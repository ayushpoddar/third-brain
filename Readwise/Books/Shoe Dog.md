## Highlights
- Consider the lilies of the field . . . they neither toil nor spin. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=586))
- Because, I realized, it wasn’t selling. I believed in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=787))
- But a few found me through my first attempt at advertising—a handout I’d designed and produced at a local print shop. Along the top, in big type, it said: Best news in flats! Japan challenges European track shoe domination! The handout then went on to explain: Low Japanese labor costs make it possible for an exciting new firm to offer these shoes at the low low price of $6.95. Along the bottom was my address and phone number. I nailed them up all over Portland. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=797))
- The art of competing, I’d learned from track, was the art of forgetting, and I now reminded myself of that fact. You must forget your limits. You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=869))
- There were many ways down Mount Fuji, according to my guidebook, but only one way up. Life lesson in that, I thought. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=938))
- Again and again I learned that lack of equity was a leading cause of failure. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1156))
- At the time I was reading everything I could get my hands on about generals, samurai, shoguns, along with biographies of my three main heroes—Churchill, Kennedy, and Tolstoy. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1282))
- Someone somewhere once said that business is war without bullets, ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1285))
- (Hemingway himself wrote most of A Moveable Feast while gazing at a statue of Marshal Ney, Napoléon’s favorite commander.) ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1287))
- One lesson I took from all my home-schooling about heroes was that they didn’t say much. None was a blabbermouth. None micromanaged. Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1288))
- But my hope was that when I failed, if I failed, I’d fail quickly, so I’d have enough time, enough years, to implement all the hard-won lessons. I wasn’t much for setting goals, but this goal kept flashing through my mind every day, until it became my internal chant: Fail fast. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1342))
- There are team players, I thought, and then there are team players, and then there’s Johnson. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1499))
- Of course it’s possible that they weren’t arrogant at all, that to motivate myself I needed to see them as a monster. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1586))
- the basic rule of negotiation is to know what you want, what you need to walk away with in order to be whole. ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1838))
- The single easiest way to find out how you feel about someone. Say goodbye. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1868))
- I was living two separate lives, both wonderful, both merging. Back home I was part of a team, me and Woodell and Johnson—and now Penny. Here in Japan I was part of a team, me and Kitami and all the good people of Onitsuka. By nature I was a loner, but since childhood I’d thrived in team sports. My psyche was in true harmony when I had a mix of alone time and team time. Exactly what I had now. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1887))
- Once again I’m telling a roomful of people that something is possible, that something can be successful, when in fact I don’t really know. I’m speaking from theory, faith, and bluster, like every groom. And every bride. It would be up to me and Penny to prove the truth of what we said that day. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=1923))
- I told myself: Life is growth. You grow or you die. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2051))
- Eventually I did what I didn’t want to do, what I’d vowed never to do. I put the touch on anybody with ears. Friends, family, casual acquaintances. I even went with my hand out to former teammates, guys I’d sweated and trained and raced alongside. Including my former archrival, Grelle. ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2273))
- “if you can’t trust the company your son is working for, then who can you trust?” ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2293))
- Yes, I thought. Confidence. More than equity, more than liquidity, that’s what a man needs. I wished I had more. I wished I could borrow some. But confidence was cash. You had to have some to get some. And people were loath to give it to you. ([Location 2320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2320))
- My deal said I could import only Onitsuka track and field shoes, no others; it said nothing about importing someone else’s football shoes. So I knew this contract with Canada wouldn’t violate the letter of my Onitsuka deal. But the spirit? Six months previously I would never have done this. Things were different now. Onitsuka had already broken the spirit of our deal, and my spirit, so I pulled the cap off my pen and signed the contract. I signed the heck out of that Canada contract. ([Location 2560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2560))
- Churchill’s voice. You ask, What is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. ([Location 2626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2626))
- MY BRAND-NEW RELATIONSHIP with Nissho was promising, but it was brand new, and who would dare predict how it might evolve? I’d once felt the relationship with Onitsuka was promising, and look where that stood. Nissho was infusing me with cash, but I couldn’t let that make me complacent. I needed to develop as many sources of cash as possible. ([Location 2632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2632))
- I didn’t think I could withstand the disappointment of a second failed offering, ([Location 2635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2635))
- “So . . . in other words,” I said. I cleared my throat again, pushed aside my yellow legal pad. “What I’m trying to say is, we’ve got them right where we want them.” Johnson lifted his eyes. Everyone around the table lifted their eyes. They sat up straighter. “This is—the moment,” I said. “This is the moment we’ve been waiting for. Our moment. No more selling someone else’s brand. No more working for someone else. Onitsuka has been holding us down for years. Their late deliveries, their mixed-up orders, their refusal to hear and implement our design ideas—who among us isn’t sick of dealing with all that? It’s time we faced facts: If we’re going to succeed, or fail, we should do so on our own terms, with our own ideas—our own brand. We posted two million in sales last year . . . none of which had anything to do with Onitsuka. That number was a testament to our ingenuity and hard work. Let’s not look at this as a crisis. Let’s look at this as our liberation. Our Independence Day. ([Location 2949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2949))
- “Yes, it’s going to be rough. I won’t lie to you. We’re definitely going to war, people. But we know the terrain. We know our way around Japan now. And that’s one reason I feel in my heart this is a war we can win. And if we win it, when we win it, I see great things for us on the other side of victory. We are still alive, people. We are still. Alive.” ([Location 2957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2957))
- Sometimes I thought the secret to Pre’s appeal was his passion. He didn’t care if he died crossing the finish line, so long as he crossed first. No matter what Bowerman told him, no matter what his body told him, Pre refused to slow down, ease off. He pushed himself to the brink and beyond. This was often a counterproductive strategy, and sometimes it was plainly stupid, and occasionally it was suicidal. But it was always uplifting for the crowd. No matter the sport—no matter the human endeavor, really—total effort will win people’s hearts. ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=2989))
- This, I decided, this is what sports are, what they can do. Like books, sports give people a sense of having lived other lives, of taking part in other people’s victories. And defeats. When sports are at their best, the spirit of the fan merges with the spirit of the athlete, and in that convergence, in that transference, is the oneness that the mystics talk about. ([Location 3018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3018))
- The cowards never started and the weak died along the way—that leaves us. ([Location 3050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3050))
- I asked Strasser early on how he gauged our chances against Onitsuka. He said we were going to win. He said it straight out, no hesitation, as if I’d asked him what he’d had for breakfast. He said it the way a sports fan would talk about “next year,” with uncompromising faith. He said it the way my father said it every night, and there and then I decided that Strasser was one of the chosen, one of the brethren. ([Location 3288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3288))
- Supply and demand is always the root problem in business. It’s been true since Phoenician traders raced to bring Rome the coveted purple dye that colored the clothing of royals and rich people; there was never enough purple to go around. ([Location 3309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3309))
- It’s hard enough to invent and manufacture and market a product, but then the logistics, the mechanics, the hydraulics of getting it to the people who want it, when they want it—this is how companies die, how ulcers are born. ([Location 3311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3311))
- I opened by telling Strasser that it was all a foregone conclusion, really. “You’re one of us,” I said. One of us. He knew what those words meant. We were the kind of people who simply couldn’t put up with corporate nonsense. We were the kind of people who wanted our work to be play. But meaningful play. We were trying to slay Goliath, and though Strasser was bigger than two Goliaths, at heart he was an utter David. We were trying to create a brand, I said, but also a culture. We were fighting against conformity, against boringness, against drudgery. More than a product, we were trying to sell an idea—a spirit. I don’t know if I ever fully understood who we were and what we were doing until I heard myself saying it all that day to Strasser. ([Location 3545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3545))
- Fear of failure, I thought, will never be our downfall as a company. Not that any of us thought we wouldn’t fail; in fact we had every expectation that we would. But when we did fail, we had faith that we’d do it fast, learn from it, and be better for it. ([Location 3613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3613))
- Don’t go to sleep one night. What you most want will come to you then. ([Location 3770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3770))
- “No brilliant idea was ever born in a conference room,” he assured the Dane. “But a lot of silly ideas have died there,” said Stahr. —F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Last Tycoon ([Location 3888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3888))
- Somebody may beat me—but they’re going to have to bleed to do it.” ([Location 3908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3908))
- I would search my mind and heart and the only thing I could come up with was this word—“winning.” It wasn’t much, but it was far, far better than the alternative. Whatever happened, I just didn’t want to lose. Losing was death. Blue Ribbon was my third child, my business child, as Sumeragi said, and I simply couldn’t bear the idea of it dying. It has to live, I told myself. It just has to. That’s all I know. ([Location 3945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3945))
- Going public would generate a ton of money in a flash. But it would also be highly perilous, because going public often meant losing control. It could mean working for someone else, suddenly being answerable to stockholders, hundreds or maybe thousands of strangers, many of whom would be large investment firms. Going public could turn us overnight into the thing we loathed, the thing we’d spent our lives running from. ([Location 3955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=3955))
- Did you know that in China, when man marries woman, they throw red shoes on the roof to make sure all goes well on wedding night? ([Location 4059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4059))
- (Years later a famous Harvard business professor studying Nike came to the same conclusion. “Normally,” he said, “if one manager at a company can think tactically and strategically, that company has a good future. But boy are you lucky: More than half the Buttfaces think that way!”) ([Location 4201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4201))
- And we were nearly all merciless self-loathers, which kept the egos in check. There was none of that smartest-guy-in-the-room foolishness. Hayes, Strasser, Woodell, Johnson, each would have been the smartest guy in any room, but none believed it of himself, or the next guy. Our meetings were defined by contempt, disdain, and heaps of abuse. ([Location 4205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4205))
- We’d buy drinks for the house, then commandeer a corner and continue laying into each other about some problem or idea or harebrained scheme. Say the problem was midsoles not getting from Point A to Point B. Round and round we’d go, everyone speaking at once, a chorale of name-calling and finger-pointing, all made louder, and funnier, and somehow clearer, by the booze. To anyone in the Owl’s Nest, to anyone in the corporate world, it would have looked inefficient, inappropriate. Even scandalous. But before the bartender gave last call, we’d know full well why those midsoles weren’t getting from Point A to Point B, and the person responsible would be contrite, and put on notice, and we’d have ourselves a creative solution. ([Location 4224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4224))
- If we couldn’t sustain growth, we couldn’t survive. And despite our fears, despite the risks and downsides, going public was the best way to sustain growth. ([Location 4244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4244))
- Was I doing right by the Buttfaces, giving them so little guidance? When they did well I’d shrug and deliver my highest praise: Not bad. When they erred I’d yell for a minute or two, then shake it off. None of the Buttfaces felt the least threatened by me—was that a good thing? Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results. It was the right tack for Patton and his GIs. But did that make it right for a bunch of Buttfaces? I worried. Maybe I should be more hands-on. Maybe we should be more structured. But then I’d think: Whatever I’m doing, it must be working, because mutinies are few. In fact, ever since Bork, no one had thrown a genuine tantrum, about anything, not even what they were paid, which is unheard of in any company, big or small. The Buttfaces knew I wasn’t paying myself much, and they trusted that I was paying them what I could. Clearly the Buttfaces liked the culture I’d created. I trusted them, wholly, and didn’t look over their shoulders, and that bred a powerful two-way loyalty. My management style wouldn’t have worked for people who wanted to be guided, every step, but this group found it liberating, empowering. I let them be, let them do, let them make their own mistakes, because that’s how I’d always liked people to treat me. ([Location 4257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4257))
- My fatherhood style, my management style. I was forever questioning, Is it good—or merely good enough? Time and again I’d vow to change. Time and again I’d tell myself: I will spend more time with the boys. Time and again I’d keep that promise—for a while. Then I’d fall back to my former routine, the only way I knew. Not hands-off. But not hands-on. ([Location 4277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4277))
- It was a strange thing to do, in the midst of an apocalyptic fight with the government. But I liked the idea of acting as if things were going to work out. ([Location 4508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4508))
- And maybe it would cure my burnout. Maybe the cure for any burnout, I thought, is to just work harder. ([Location 4703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4703))
- The cowards never started and the weak died along the way. That leaves us, ladies and gentlemen. Us. ([Location 4999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=4999))
- “You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.” ([Location 5213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5213))
- To study the self is to forget the self. ([Location 5221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5221))
- I remember that he wore a dark business suit, like mine. I remember that he smiled as I did—shyly, uncertainly. But there was an intensity about him. I’d seen that kind of glittery confidence in great coaches, and great business leaders, the elite of the elite. I never saw it in a mirror. ([Location 5293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5293))
- If you can’t trust the company your son works for, who can you trust? ([Location 5334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5334))
- It would be nice to help them avoid the typical discouragements. I’d tell them to hit pause, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. I’d tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt. I’d like to warn the best of them, the iconoclasts, the innovators, the rebels, that they will always have a bull’s-eye on their backs. The better they get, the bigger the bull’s-eye. It’s not one man’s opinion; it’s a law of nature. ([Location 5384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5384))
- And those who urge entrepreneurs to never give up? Charlatans. Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop. ([Location 5393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5393))
- Luck plays a big role. Yes, I’d like to publicly acknowledge the power of luck. Athletes get lucky, poets get lucky, businesses get lucky. Hard work is critical, a good team is essential, brains and determination are invaluable, but luck may decide the outcome. Some people might not call it luck. They might call it Tao, or Logos, or Jñāna, or Dharma. Or Spirit. Or God. ([Location 5395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5395))
- Put it this way. The harder you work, the better your Tao. And since no one has ever adequately defined Tao, I now try to go regularly to mass. I would tell them: Have faith in yourself, but also have faith in faith. Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart. ([Location 5398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=5398))
