## Highlights
- financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=93))
- To grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need to study interest rates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. To get why investors sell out at the bottom of a bear market you don’t need to study the math of expected future returns; you need to think about the agony of looking at your family and wondering if your investments are imperiling their future.

    - Note: Not for notes
- Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=140))
- You know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences. Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. So equally smart people can disagree about how and why recessions happen, how you should invest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk you should take, and so on. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=155))
- I can read about what it was like to lose everything during the Great Depression. But I don’t have the emotional scars of those who actually experienced it. And the person who lived through it can’t fathom why someone like me could come across as complacent about things like owning stocks. We see the world through a different lens. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=170))
- Spreadsheets can model the historic frequency of big stock market declines. But they can’t model the feeling of coming home, looking at your kids, and wondering if you’ve made a mistake that will impact their lives. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=173))
- As investor Michael Batnick says, “some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood.” ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=177))
- The economists wrote: “Our findings suggest that individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.” Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luck of when and where you were born. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=187))
- Local stock markets in Germany and Japan were wiped out during World War II. Entire regions were bombed out. At the end of the war German farms only produced enough food to provide the country’s citizens with 1,000 calories a day. Compare that to the U.S., where the stock market more than doubled from 1941 through the end of 1945, and the economy was the strongest it had been in almost two decades. No one should expect members of these groups to go through the rest of their lives thinking the same thing about inflation. Or the stock market. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=207))
- No one should expect them to respond to financial information the same way. No one should assume they are influenced by the same incentives. No one should expect them to trust the same sources of advice. No one should expect them to agree on what matters, what’s worth it, what’s likely to happen next, and what the best path forward is. Their view of money was formed in different worlds. And when that’s the case, a view about money that one group of people thinks is outrageous can make perfect sense to another. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=212))
- Few people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting. Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=251))
- King Alyattes of Lydia, now part of Turkey, is thought to have created the first official currency in 600 BC. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=255))
- Before World War II most Americans worked until they died. That was the expectation and the reality. The labor force participation rate of men age 65 and over was above 50% until the 1940s: ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=260))
- Social Security aimed to change this. But its initial benefits were nothing close to a proper pension. When Ida May Fuller cashed the first Social Security check in 1940, it was for $22.54, or $416 adjusted for inflation. It was not until the 1980s that the average Social Security check for retirees exceeded $1,000 a month adjusted for inflation. More than a quarter of Americans over age 65 were classified by the Census Bureau as living in poverty until the late 1960s. There is a widespread belief along the lines of, “everyone used to have a private pension.” But this is wildly exaggerated. The Employee Benefit Research Institute explains: “Only a quarter of those age 65 or older had pension income in 1975.” Among that lucky minority, only 15% of household income came from a pension. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=263))
    - Note: Facts
- It was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone deserves, and should have, a dignified retirement took hold. And the way to get that dignified retirement ever since has been an expectation that everyone will save and invest their own money. Let me reiterate how new this idea is: The 401(k)—the backbone savings vehicle of American retirement—did not exist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. If it were a person it would be barely old enough to drink. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=271))
- Even widespread use of consumer debt—mortgages, credit cards, and car loans—did not take off until after World War II, when the GI Bill made it easier for millions of Americans to borrow. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=282))
- Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer. The story of how Lakeside School, just outside Seattle, even got a computer is remarkable. Bill Dougall was a World War II navy pilot turned high school math and science teacher. “He believed that book study wasn’t enough without real-world experience. He also realized that we’d need to know something about computers when we got to college,” recalled late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. In 1968 Dougall petitioned the Lakeside School Mothers’ Club to use the proceeds from its annual rummage sale—about $3,000—to lease a Teletype Model 30 computer hooked up to the General Electric mainframe terminal for computer time-sharing. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in 1965,” Gates later said. “Someone was pretty forwardlooking.” Most university graduate schools did not have a computer anywhere near as advanced as Bill Gates had access to in eighth grade. And he couldn’t get enough of it. Gates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul Allen. Allen was also obsessed with the school’s computer, and the two hit it off. Lakeside’s computer wasn’t part of its general curriculum. It was an independent study program. Bill and Paul could toy away with the thing at their leisure, letting their creativity run wild—after school, late into the night, on weekends. They quickly became computing experts.

    - Note: Facts
- Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=339))
- Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes among brothers are more correlated than height or weight. If you are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to also be rich than he is tall. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=355))
- Cornelius Vanderbilt had just finished a series of business deals to expand his railroad empire. One of his business advisors leaned in to tell Vanderbilt that every transaction he agreed to broke the law. “My God, John,” said Vanderbilt, “You don’t suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statutes of the State of New York, do you?”10 My first thought when reading this was: “That attitude is why he was so successful.” Laws didn’t accommodate railroads during Vanderbilt’s day. So he said “to hell with it” and went ahead anyway. Vanderbilt was wildly successful. So it’s tempting to view his law-flaunting—which was notorious and vital to his success—as sage wisdom. That scrappy visionary let nothing get in his way! But how dangerous is that analysis? No sane person would recommend flagrant crime as an entrepreneurial trait. You can easily imagine Vanderbilt’s story turning out much different—an outlaw whose young company collapsed under court order.

    - Note: Facts
- Benjamin Graham is known as one of the greatest investors of all time, the father of value investing and the early mentor of Warren Buffett. But the majority of Benjamin Graham’s investing success was due to owning an enormous chunk of GEICO stock which, by his own admission, broke nearly every diversification rule that Graham himself laid out in his famous texts. Where does the thin line between bold and reckless fall here? I don’t know. Graham wrote about his GEICO bonanza: “One lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision—can we tell them apart?” Not easily. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=404))
    - Note: Facts
- just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can be attributed to effort and decisions. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=420))
- Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples—the billionaires, the CEOs, or the massive failures that dominate the news—and extreme examples are often the least applicable to other situations, given their complexity. The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck or risk. You’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life. Trying to emulate Warren Buffett’s investment success is hard, because his results are so extreme that the role of luck in his lifetime performance is very likely high, and luck isn’t something you can reliably emulate. But realizing, as we’ll see in chapter 7, that people who have control over their time tend to be happier in life is a broad and common enough observation that you can do something with it. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=426))
- The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won’t wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor. But more important is that as much as we recognize the role of luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=442))
- In the early 1900s a Serbian scientist named Milutin Milanković studied the Earth’s position relative to other planets and came up with the theory of ice ages that we now know is accurate: The gravitational pull of the sun and moon gently affect the Earth’s motion and tilt toward the sun. During parts of this cycle— which can last tens of thousands of years—each of the Earth’s hemispheres gets a little more, or a little less, solar radiation than they’re used to. And that is where the fun begins. Milanković’s theory initially assumed that a tilt of the Earth’s hemispheres caused ravenous winters cold enough to turn the planet into ice. But a Russian meteorologist named Wladimir Köppen dug deeper into Milanković’s work and discovered a fascinating nuance. Moderately cool summers, not cold winters, were the icy culprit. It begins when a summer never gets warm enough to melt the previous winter’s snow. The leftover ice base makes it easier for snow to accumulate the following winter, which increases the odds of snow sticking around in the following summer, which attracts even more accumulation the following winter. Perpetual snow reflects more of the sun’s rays, which exacerbates cooling, which brings more snowfall, and on and on. Within a few hundred years a seasonal snowpack grows into a continental ice sheet, and you’re off to the races.

- you don’t need tremendous force to create tremendous results. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=590))
- Warren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key point if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. The real key to his success is that he’s been a phenomenal investor for three quarters of a century. Had he started investing in his 30s and retired in his 60s, few people would have ever heard of him. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=598))
- Jim Simons, head of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, has compounded money at 66% annually since 1988. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=612))
- The practical takeaway is that the counterintuitiveness of compounding may be responsible for the majority of disappointing trades, bad strategies, and successful investing attempts. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=646))
- good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=649))
- Good investing is not necessarily about making good decisions. It’s about consistently not screwing up. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=655))
- The blockbusters stopped, a few big-budget projects flopped, and by the mid-1990s Carolco was history. It went bankrupt in 1996. Stock goes to zero, have a nice day. A catastrophic loss. And one that 4 in 10 public companies experience over time. Carolco’s story is not worth telling because it’s unique, but because it’s common. Here’s the most important part of this story: The Russell 3000 has increased more than 73-fold since 1980. That is a spectacular return. That is success. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=865))
    - Note: Story
- Forty percent of the companies in the index were effectively failures. But the 7% of components that performed extremely well were more than enough to offset the duds. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=869))
- Not only do a few companies account for most of the market’s return, but within those companies are even more tail events. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=871))
- The idea that a few things account for most results is not just true for companies in your investment portfolio. It’s also an important part of your own behavior as an investor. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=879))
- Over the course of your lifetime as an investor the decisions that you make today or tomorrow or next week will not matter nearly as much as what you do during the small number of days—likely 1% of the time or less—when everyone else around you is going crazy. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=884))
- Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=901))
- When you accept that tails drive everything in business, investing, and finance you realize that it’s normal for lots of things to go wrong, break, fail, and fall. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=904))
- If you’re a good investor most years will be just OK, and plenty will be bad. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=907))
- There are fields where you must be perfect every time. Flying a plane, for example. Then there are fields where you want to be at least pretty good nearly all the time. A restaurant chef, let’s say. Investing, business, and finance are just not like these fields. Something I’ve learned from both investors and entrepreneurs is that no one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressive people are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon. ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=911))
- At the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2013 Warren Buffett said he’s owned 400 to 500 stocks during his life and made most of his money on 10 of them. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=939))
- “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=945))
- The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=957))

- Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=964))

- Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated— is its ability to give you control over your time. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=968))
- Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania, summed it up well: People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=988))

- If your job is to build cars, there is little you can do when you’re not on the assembly line. You detach from work and leave your tools in the factory. But if your job is to create a marketing campaign—a thought-based and decision job—your tool is your head, which never leaves you. You might be thinking about your project during your commute, as you’re making dinner, while you put your kids to sleep, and when you wake up stressed at three in the morning. You might be on the clock for fewer hours than you would in 1950. But it feels like you’re working 24/7. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1033))
- Compared to generations prior, control over your time has diminished. And since controlling your time is such a key happiness influencer, we shouldn’t be surprised that people don’t feel much happier even though we are, on average, richer than ever. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1042))
- What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. “Your kids don’t want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,” ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1053))
- When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.” Subconscious or not, this is how people think. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1065))
- “You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect and admire you.” ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1070))
- If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1080))

- Someone driving a $100,000 car might be wealthy. But the only data point you have about their wealth is that they have $100,000 less than they did before they bought the car (or $100,000 more in debt).

Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1101))
- Investor Bill Mann once wrote: “There is no faster way to feel rich than to spend lots of money on really nice things. But the way to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend money you don’t have. It’s really that simple.”31 ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1109)) ^ccb7e3
- wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.

- In the 1970s the world looked like it was running out of oil. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1154))
    - Note: Story on oil crisis. Start
- We didn’t run out of oil, thank goodness. But that wasn’t just because we found more oil, or even got better at taking it out of the ground. The biggest reason we overcame the oil crisis is because we started building cars, factories, and homes that are more energy efficient than they used to be. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1156))

    - Note: Fun fact
- The world grew its “energy wealth” not by increasing the energy it had, but by decreasing the energy it needed. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1161)) ^f21b10
- finding more energy is largely out of our control and shrouded in uncertainty, ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1163))
- becoming more efficient with the energy we use is largely in our control. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1164))
- Investment returns can make you rich. But whether an investing strategy will work, and how long it will work for, and whether markets will cooperate, is always in doubt. Results are shrouded in uncertainty. Personal savings and frugality—finance’s conservation and efficiency—are parts of the money equation that are more in your control and have a 100% chance of being as effective in the future as they are today. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1166))
- If you view building wealth as something that will require more money or big investment returns, you may become as pessimistic as the energy doomers were in the 1970s. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1170))
- If you view it as powered by your own frugality and efficiency, the destiny is clearer. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1172))
- Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income, but have no chance of building wealth without a high savings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.
