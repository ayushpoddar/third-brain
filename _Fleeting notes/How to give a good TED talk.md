It is all about the idea.

1. Your talk should just focus on one major idea, the one that you care about the most
	1. Everything you say should link back to your idea in some way
2. Give the audience a reason to care about your idea. 
	1. The best tool to do so is "curiosity"
	2. Ask them questions to expose gaps in their worldview. This way the audience would want to fill gaps in their worldview. That way you have their attention
3. Construct the idea piece by piece
	1. Use concepts that your audience is already aware of to build your idea for them
	2. Don't use your language. Use their language.
	3. Use metaphors if need be. For example, to explain the DNA editing technology, you can use the metaphor "Microsoft Word for DNAs"
4. Make your idea worth sharing
	1. The idea should benefit your audience, not you
	2. If you believe that your idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk
