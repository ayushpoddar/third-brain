Developers are skeptical of ads:
Developers are often perceived as being averse to ads and sales pitches.
This perception is not entirely unfounded, as many developers prefer to rely on community engagement and influencer marketing.

Community engagement has its limits:
While community engagement can be effective, it is not always scalable.
For B2D brands serving a limited audience, such as DevOps and SREs, influencer marketing alone may not be enough to drive growth.

Paid ads can work for developers:
Paid ads can be an effective way to amplify the voices of influencers and reach a wider audience.
However, push ads that are intrusive and poorly targeted are not suitable for developer-focused companies.

Pull ads are the way to go:
In-feed ads that give users the choice to watch or not are a better option for targeting developers.
When users self-qualify for ads, marketers can be more confident that they are allocating their budget towards the right audience.
