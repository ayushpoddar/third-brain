# Proof (from ChatGPT)
Yes, it can be proven that any common divisor of two numbers `a` and `b` also divides their greatest common divisor (GCD), denoted as `gcd(a, b)`. We can use Bézout's identity to prove this.

Bézout's Identity states that for any two integers `a` and `b`, there exist integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.

Now, let's say `d` is a common divisor of `a` and `b`. This means `a = dm` and `b = dn` for some integers `m` and `n`.

Substituting `a` and `b` into Bézout's identity gives us `d(m*x + n*y) = gcd(a, b)`.

From this, we can see that `d` is a factor of `gcd(a, b)`, because the left hand side of the equation is `d` times some integer, and this equals `gcd(a, b)`. 

So, any common divisor of `a` and `b` also divides their greatest common divisor. This is a fundamental property of the GCD and is important in many areas of number theory and mathematics.

## Bezout's Identity (from ChatGPT)
Absolutely, let's consider an example:

Let's say we have two integers, `a = 12` and `b = 15`. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers is `3`.

Bézout's Identity tells us that there exist integers `x` and `y` such that:

`ax + by = d`

where `d` is the GCD of `a` and `b`. 

To find `x` and `y`, we need to solve this equation for `x` and `y`. This is usually done using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

In this case, there are multiple solutions, one of which is `x = -1` and `y = 1`, because:

`(12 * -1) + (15 * 1) = -12 + 15 = 3`

which is indeed the GCD of 12 and 15.

So, Bézout's Identity is satisfied for `a = 12`, `b = 15`, `x = -1`, and `y = 1`.
