# How to give a good TED talk?
It is all about the idea.

1. Your talk should just focus on one major idea, the one that you care about the most
	1. Everything you say should link back to your idea in some way
2. Give the audience a reason to care about your idea. 
	1. The best tool to do so is "curiosity"
	2. Ask them questions to expose gaps in their worldview. This way the audience would want to fill gaps in their worldview. That way you have their attention
3. Construct the idea piece by piece
	1. Use concepts that your audience is already aware of to build your idea for them
	2. Don't use your language. Use their language.
	3. Use metaphors if need be. For example, to explain the DNA editing technology, you can use the metaphor "Microsoft Word for DNAs"
4. Make your idea worth sharing
	1. The idea should benefit your audience, not you
	2. If you believe that your idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk

## Analyze your audience
### Know your audience
- Who is my audience?
- What do they want?
- How do they feel about the topic? Are they excited or are they anxious?
- What do they already know about the topic?
	- You don't want to bore them with what they already know
- What do they need to know to understand your presentation?
- What questions they might have?
	- At the end of it all, every presentation is all about just answering questions that your audience might have
- What parts of your presentation might make them resistant or skeptical to your idea?
	- You don't want to avoid those topics. You should identify those feelings of resistance and skepticism.  Identify the elephant in the room

### What you want from your audience? - Craft your speaking goal
- What do you want them to **know** or **think** after your presentation?
- How do you want them to **feel** after your presentation?
	- You may be wanting a positive feeling in them, or you might want a feeling of urgency
- What do you want you audience to **do** after the presentation?
	- This is the **call to action**
	- May be you want them to fill a expense report form

### Sum up your presentation in a sentence (less than 12 words) - Craft your 12-word message
- This helps weed out the irrelevant parts of the presentation
- Helps you keep it focused
- Keeps out **Interesting but irrelevant (IBI)** stuff

## Structure your content
### Using the power of 3 to structure your ideas
- Think of 3 concepts that you want to cover in your presentation (related to the main idea, ofcourse)
	- Three is not a hard number. You could always go with $\pm 1$.
	- Think of it more as a guideline marker
- Next, you could go one level down and think of 3 aspects you want to cover for each of the concept.
- You can keep repeating this by going one level down each time

### The Power of Repetition - Introduction and Conclusion
- Introduction: Tell them what you're going to tell them
- Body: Tell them
- Conclusion: Tell them what you told them
- It is important to have repetition so that your ideas stick in the minds of your audience
