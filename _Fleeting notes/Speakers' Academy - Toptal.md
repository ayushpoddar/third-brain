# How to give a good TED talk?
It is all about the idea.

1. Your talk should just focus on one major idea, the one that you care about the most
	1. Everything you say should link back to your idea in some way
2. Give the audience a reason to care about your idea. 
	1. The best tool to do so is "curiosity"
	2. Ask them questions to expose gaps in their worldview. This way the audience would want to fill gaps in their worldview. That way you have their attention
3. Construct the idea piece by piece
	1. Use concepts that your audience is already aware of to build your idea for them
	2. Don't use your language. Use their language.
	3. Use metaphors if need be. For example, to explain the DNA editing technology, you can use the metaphor "Microsoft Word for DNAs"
4. Make your idea worth sharing
	1. The idea should benefit your audience, not you
	2. If you believe that your idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk

## Analyze your audience
### Know your audience
- Who is my audience?
- What do they want?
- How do they feel about the topic? Are they excited or are they anxious?
- What do they already know about the topic?
	- You don't want to bore them with what they already know
- What do they need to know to understand your presentation?
- What questions they might have?
	- At the end of it all, every presentation is all about just answering questions that your audience might have
- What parts of your presentation might make them resistant or skeptical to your idea?
	- You don't want to avoid those topics. You should identify those feelings of resistance and skepticism.  Identify the elephant in the room

### What you want from your audience? - Craft your speaking goal
- What do you want them to **know** or **think** after your presentation?
- How do you want them to **feel** after your presentation?
	- You may be wanting a positive feeling in them, or you might want a feeling of urgency
- What do you want you audience to **do** after the presentation?
	- This is the **call to action**
	- May be you want them to fill a expense report form

### Sum up your presentation in a sentence (less than 12 words) - Craft your 12-word message
- This helps weed out the irrelevant parts of the presentation
- Helps you keep it focused
- Keeps out **Interesting but irrelevant (IBI)** stuff

## Structure your content
### Using the power of 3 to structure your ideas
- Think of 3 concepts that you want to cover in your presentation (related to the main idea, ofcourse)
	- Three is not a hard-coded number. You could always go with $\pm 1$.
	- Think of it more as a guideline marker
- Next, you could go one level down and think of 3 aspects you want to cover for each of the concept.
- You can keep repeating this by going one level down each time

### The Power of Repetition - Introduction and Conclusion
- Introduction: Tell them what you're going to tell them
- Body: Tell them
- Conclusion: Tell them what you told them
- It is important to have repetition so that your ideas stick in the minds of your audience

## Tell a story
### Keep them specific
- Give your stories a face, even if it is a fictional one
- For example, if you are sharing the your marketing success strategies, create a fictional client (give it a name, a background) and then walk through the details
	- This way your facts and strategies get personified

### Keep them lively
- Give some details in the story. Add dialogues if necessary
- Example: Instead of saying that we worked long hours, say that there were 35 empty boxes of pizza stacked.
	- Help the audience visualise the story by sharing some details

### Keep them relevant
- The point of the story should be clear to you and your audience.
- You could even use phrases like "The point of this story is..." or "The reason I am telling you this story is..."

### Creating a story bank
- Collect stories in a story bank
- For every story, think about:
	- One or two line summary of the story
	- A couple of details to make the story lively
	- The kind of emotions that the story generates
	- The point of the story

### Before a presentation
- Practice telling the story out loud. There is no point in practising it in head. It is as good as thinking about going to the gym.

## Delivery skills
- Don't avoid eye contact. Try and make eye contact with each member of the audience for 3-5 seconds. _Probably the most important of all_
- Your hands should communicate openness and confidence.
	- If you are using gestures: make sure that your hands have the room to expand into the whole wingspan
	- If you are not gesturing: You can keep your hands by your side, keep your hands near your navel in a tent position
- Stand like a speaker. Straight and balanced on both legs
- Silence is your friend. Instead of using filler words, remain silent
- When preparing for a talk, don't write a script to follow word-by-word. Instead, just list down the talking points and key phrases.
	- Practice your talk **out loud**.
	- This way you can get the naturality in your presentation and avoid being flat-lined. Look at [this video](https://youtu.be/uhicfdweqfa) to see what flat-line delivery is
	- In general life, you are not flat-lined.
- Slow down your pace of delivery
	- Use pauses between ideas, concepts and sentences when speaking. This will also allow you to take a breath and reset
	- Set some repetitive key phrase as an indicator to slow down. For example: You could set "continuous delivery" as an indicator to slow down. Now, whenever you say the phrase "continuous delivery" in your speech, you should slow down

## Think and Speak on your feet - PREP framework
### PREP Framework - Point, Reason, Example, Point
- Front load your point and reason. Don't have to talk through all the background and context
- If you feel your talk is too short to not need the point to be repeated again at the end, follow your gut and avoid repetition
- Expect your performance to dip temporarily by adopting the PREP framework. It happens because you are internalizing a new habit.

### Alternate frameworks
### PER - Point, Example, Relevance
- Tell what you are going to say
- Give an example
- Tell how is your talk relevant

### What, So What, Now What
- What you are going to talk about
- Why should the audience care about your content
- Provide the next steps or call-to-action

### Past, Present, Future
- Situation earlier
- Situation now
- Situation planned/expected for future

## Flipping nervousness into excitement
- Create a power soundtrack, which can get you all energetic and pumped up. Listen to it before the presentation
- Do some kind of short physical activity like a 5-minute brisk walk or 5-minute jumping jacks. This will vent out your nervous energy
- Change your self-talk. From saying "I have to give the talk", go to saying "I get to give the talk"
