# What may seem atrocious to you, may make sense to someone else
- New York Times wrote a story on the atrocious working conditions of Foxconn (Taiwanese electronics manufacturer)
- Readers were, justifiably, upset.

## Other side of the coin

> [!quote] The nephew of the Chinese worker had a fascinating response
> My aunt worked several years in what Americans call “sweat shops.” It was hard work. Long hours, “small” wage, “poor” working conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before she worked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute. 
> The idea of working in a “sweat shop” compared to that old lifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would rather be “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several men for pennies.
> That is why I am upset by many Americans’ thinking. We do not have the same opportunities as the West. Our governmental infrastructure is different. The country is different. Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare such to American jobs.
